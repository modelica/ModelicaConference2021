# Authors' guide

## Submission process

Papers should be submitted via the [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=modelica2021) conference management system.

There you can also read your reviews and hand in the final paper after the reviewing process has taken place. In order to submit a paper, you need to have an EasyChair account. Simply follow the provided instructions to create an account. The same account can be used for several conferences over several years, so if you have already participated in a Modelica conference you might already have a valid account.

Once you have logged in, you can upload your contribution in the section: "New submissions". Simply follow the instructions.

The paper submission form includes the option to mark suitable topics for your paper.
Please use this feature since it helps us to find suitable reviewers for your paper.
Furthermore, there is the option to attach a .zip file to your paper.
In this way, you can provide example models that correspond to your paper.

## Preparation of full papers

The template has been updated for the 2021 conference, so do not use older versions of the template.
Please use the [LaTeX template](https://github.com/modelica-association/conference-templates/tree/master/LaTeX) for the creation of full papers.
There is a [Word template](https://github.com/modelica-association/conference-templates/tree/master/MSWord) that is based on the LaTeX template.
The Word template contains some wording specific to LaTeX packages; when drafting a document in Word, please make the contents look similar to what the LaTeX templates produce.
For draft paper submissions, you may also use other templates (but include an extra page at the end stating you will use the correct template for the final submission).

Please make sure that your submission has been created according to the [Modelica Formatting Guidelines](formatting.md).

For the final submission, there will also be the possibility to submit Modelica example model files that correspond to your publication. These files will then be attached to your paper in the Modelica Association copy of the proceedings (but not the LiU e-press copy that the DOI points to).

## Final Paper Submission

Additionally to your paper, you should also submit a [copyright agreement](Documents/Modelica2021_copyright_form.pdf) that gives the Modelica Association the non-exclusive right to publish your paper. Please sign the form and upload it in [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=modelica2021) together with the final paper version.
 

We appreciate if you upload a one-page abstract, too.
Use the same template as for the paper, but cut it down to a teaser for attendees.

## Technical equipment for presentations

Papers must be presented during the conference, as a pre-recorded video shown during conference and optionally in person. Instructions for uploading pre-recorded presentations will be available end of August.

Papers that are not presented will be retracted.
