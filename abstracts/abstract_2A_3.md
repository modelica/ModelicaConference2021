Abstract

This article presents the different approaches and use
cases for efficient parameterization of Modelica models
by means of external data resources. The main motivation
is to improve the overall quality, testability and reusability
of Modelica application models (both on component and
system level) by a separation of the behavioral implementation
from its actual design parameters. The Modelica
libraries ExternData and ModelicaTableAdditions
are freely available to support library developers and vendors
in their ambitions to offer clean and dedicated interfaces
for the parameterization of the application models
and to benefit from a large variability of commonly used
file types, such as CSV, Excel, HDF, JSON, MATLAB
MAT, XML or even domain-specific file types such as for
tire properties or weather data.
