Abstract

To get reliable simulation results from a Modelica
model it is important to parametrize and initialize the
model using the best estimate of the state of the system.
Commonly, this state estimation is done by inverse
calculation on a square system of equations requiring as
many known values as states to be computed. In practice
this constraint is an important limitation and, in addition,
this method does not provide any information on the
uncertainties or confidence level associated to the
estimated state.
Taking advantage of the mathematical formulation of
Modelica equations, this paper presents a new method
to cope with the difficulties associated to the inverse
calculation method. This approach adapts and extends
the framework of data assimilation to provide a fully integrated
Modelica tool, which efficiently can handle
every type of state estimation problem for static models.
This method has been successfully tested with simple
and complex Modelica models. Finally, the Modelica
implementation of this technique allows to easily extend
it to further applications.
