Abstract

Energy storage systems have been gaining attention as a
means of load management in grid-interactive efficient
buildings. This study investigated the physics of the ice
storage tank (IST) and implemented an IST model in
Modelica. The developed IST Modelica model was
compared with a similar model in EnergyPlus and was
validated against experimental data from a testbed at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology. Three
statistical performance metrics were used to quantify the
accuracy of the IST model. Validation results
(CV(RMSE) ≤ 10.20 %, NMBE ≤ 0.44 %) show that the
proposed model has a good prediction accuracy according
to ASHRAE Guideline 14.
