Abstract

Buildings in cities are one of the major contributors of carbon
emissions worldwide. Thus, improving building energy
efficiency is one of the key strategies towards sustainable
urbanization. Urban building energy modeling
(UBEM) is a valuable methodology to tackle these challenges,
as it provides users with the energy demand of
the building stock, scenarios evaluation, peak loads and
other useful analyses. This paper presents an open-source
tool to automatically convert 3D building models into
ready-to-run Modelica models for urban energy simulations.
The software enables users to create 3D building
geometries, perform data enrichment and execute model
generation of reduced order Modelica models. The software
is written in Python and it has been developed as an
add-on for the 3D creation application Blender. The first
part of the paper describes the general approach and the
architecture of the tool. In the second part, a demonstration
of the tool’s capabilities is illustrated.
