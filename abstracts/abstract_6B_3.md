Abstract

There is a lack of Modeling and Simulation software systems
in the bioscience arena that give both solutions compliant
with current methodologies in drug discovery (pharmaceutic)
and precision medicine (healthcare) fields, besides
to support the addition of new biological mechanisms
under a multilevel and multiformalism perspective,
without penalize strongly the model sharing and reusing.
A novel modeling and simulation software that tries to
fill the previous gap has been designed (CybSim) and
it is presented in this work. CybSim is a platform for
multilevel modeling of physiological - cybernetic systems,
compliant but not limited to Physiologically based-
, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PK/PD)
methodologies. This capability is governed through the
Physiological Scope setting value. The main physiological
components are mechanistic. The underlying mechanisms
may be changed during the model building thanks
to the separation between mechanisms and physiological
instances. This capability is based on a multi-layer design.
A preliminary version of CybSim has been implemented
with OpenModelica (v1.14.1). A PBPK semiphysiological
model published previously has been built as a case
study to demonstrate the feasibility of CybSim. The accuracy
of CybSim was verified during preliminary development
phases. The two pointed out capabilities of Cyb-
Sim demanded an object-oriented and acausal equationbased
modeling language, able to support classes’ redeclaration,
connectors’ causality, inner/outer scoping control
and packages organization. These features are not supported
by other modern acausal equation-based modeling
languages like the EcosimPro language.
