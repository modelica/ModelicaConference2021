Abstract

In Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE), some functional
sub-systems can have a considerable influence on
the overall system behaviour, whilst the effect of other
ones can be neglected. Of course, the former requires a refined
modelling approach, whilst the latter can be suitably
represented by means of low-fidelity models (usually 0D
models). Being capable of identifying the required precision
level of sub-systems can help reducing the system
complexity, with a negligible impact on the overall accuracy
and help deepen the calculations in the system parts
where it is necessary.
To determine which sub-systems models must be
refined, suitable indicators must be introduced to assess
their influence on the global system behaviour. To this
purpose, in this work, a sensitivity analysis based on
Sobol’s indices coupled with a simple mechanical model
developed in the Modelica environment is proposed to
achieve the aforementioned task.
