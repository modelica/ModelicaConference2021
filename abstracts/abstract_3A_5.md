Abstract

This paper introduces the DLR Thermofluid Stream Library:
a free open-source library for the robust modeling
of complex thermofluid architectures. Designed to be easy
to use, easy to adapt and enriched by a number of examples,
this library contains the fundamental components for
many different applications such as thermal management
of electric cars, power plants, or building physics.
