## Developing Protective Limiters for a Hydro Power Controller in Modelica

**Luxshan Manoranjan, Dietmar Winkler**

Abstract

In recent years the operation of electrical power plants has
become more and more challenging due to a more dynamic
operation pattern in order to keep the voltage quality
within the limits of what the electrical network regulators
allow. This is due to the ever increasing amount
of unregulated renewable energy (e.g., wind, solar, tidal
power). There is a need for better tools that allow for a
better and more accurate simulation of the operation of
a electrical power plant. This paper presents the development
of protective limiters as used in a typical hydro
power controller. The limiters have been implemented using
the Modelica language (Modelica Association 2017)
and are according to the IEEE Std 421.5-201 (IEEE 2016).
Having the limiters available in Modelica makes it possible
to integrate them with hydro power system models
build with the use of OpenHPL (TMCC 2019). The behaviour
of the limiters have been tested against a verified
generator model of the OpenIPSL (ALSETLab et al.
2018) comparing the theoretical behaviour.
