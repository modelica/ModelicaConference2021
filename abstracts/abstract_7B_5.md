Storage Technologies for Energy Autarkic Residential Complexes

Abstract
We present an assessment of different types of hydrogen
storages used as long term energy buffers for a local community
complex of households in terms of economics and
energy autarky. The models used in this study are partly
based on the TransiEnt Modelica Library, which is being
developed for the dynamic simulation of coupled energy
supply systems with high shares of renewable energies. It
turns out that dynamic simulations are mandatory in order
to optimise the system parameters. Starting from a best
case evaluation of a one year linear optimisation we develop
a forecast based control logic of the whole energy
system, including its physicalities. Based on our results, a
storage consisting of pressurized gas bottles has proven to
be the most favourite solution in terms of price and level
of autarky. A liquid organic hydrogen carrier might be a
competitive alternative for larger urban districts.
