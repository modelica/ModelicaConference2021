Abstract

During the process of modelling an existing dynamic
physical system, it may be hard to capture some of
the phenomena exactly on the basis of only textbookequations.
With measurement data from the real system,
approximators like artificial neural networks can help
improve the models. However, simulation and machine
learning are usually done in different software applications.
A unified environment for modeling, simulation and
optimization would be highly valuable. We here present
a framework within the Julia programming language that
encompasses tools for acausal modeling, automatic differentiation
rsp. sensitivity analysis involving solvers for differential
equations. We use it to build and evaluate an easily
interpretable model based on both physics and data.
