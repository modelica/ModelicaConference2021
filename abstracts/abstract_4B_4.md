Abstract
The efficiency of heat pump systems is highly dependent
on the temperature gap between the sink and the source
side. Therefore, it is necessary to accurately model
the sink side to enable the most accurate and holistic
analysis of building energy systems. In both residential
and non-residential buildings, underfloor heating systems
are becoming more and more widely used. The use of
underfloor heating lowers the flow temperature of the
heating system compared to a radiator, which increases
the efficiency of a heat pump system. This paper provides
an underfloor heating system model including automatic
parametrization according to the European standard for
surface embedded heating and cooling systems EN 1264.
Since the model represents a whole underfloor system,
it consists at the system level of the distributor and
several heating circuits and takes the heat transfer at the
smallest level from a pipe element through different floor
layers into account. The model is verified for the system
requirements according to European standard EN 1264.
A parameter study with a variety of different underfloor
heating parameters and floor layers shows that reductions
in heat transfer in the underfloor heating system are
compensated by an increase in the flow temperature. The
highest influence on the temperature level of the system
is exerted by the pipe spacing T, which raises the flow
temperature by up to 10:9 K, from 36:6 °C (T = 100 mm)
to 47:5 °C (T = 400 mm). The model is freely available
