Abstract

Establishing interoperability is an essential aspect of the
often-pursued shift towards Model-Based System Engineering
(MBSE) of, for example, aircraft. If models are to
be the primary information carriers during development,
the applied methods to enable interaction between engineering
domains need to be modular, reusable, and scalable.
Given the long life cycles and often large and heterogeneous
development organizations in the aircraft industry,
one possible solution is to rely on open standards
and tools. In this paper, the standards Functional Mockup
Interface (FMI) and System Structure and Parameterization
(SSP) are exploited to exchange data between the
disciplines of systems simulation and geometry modeling.
A method to export data from the 3D Computer Aided
Design (CAD) Software (SW) CATIA in the SSP format
is developed and presented. Analogously, FMI support
of the Modeling & Simulation (M&S) tools OMSimulator,
OpenModelica, and Dymola is utilized along with the
SSP support of OMSimulator. The developed technology
is put into context by means of integration with the M&S
methodology for aircraft vehicle system development deployed
at Saab Aeronautics. Finally, the established interoperability
is demonstrated in an industrially relevant usecase.
A primary goal of the research is to prototype and
demonstrate functionality, enabled by the SSP and FMI
standards, that could improve on MBSE methodology implemented
in industry and academia.
