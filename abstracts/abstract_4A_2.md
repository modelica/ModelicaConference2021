##Seismic Hybrid Testing using FMI-based Co-Simulation

**Cl√°udio Gomes, Giuseppe Abbiati, Peter Gorm Larsen**

Abstract

Hybrid testing is an experimental technique extensively
utilized in earthquake engineering to study the seismic response
of structures. It requires coupling physical and numerical
models in a closed feedback loop. Although this
methodology is mature, a commonly accepted standard for
orchestrating simulations and experiments is still missing.
As a result, setting up a hybrid testing campaign still requires
substantial system integration effort, which is often
not affordable. In this paper, we propose the Functional
Mockup Interface as a possible standard for orchestrating
hybrid testing and discuss the limitations in enabling such
support.
