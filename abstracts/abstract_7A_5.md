Compile-Time Impulse Analysis in Modelica
Albert Benveniste1 Beno√Æt Caillaud1 Mathias Malandain1

Abstract
Since its 3.3 release, Modelica offers the possibility to
specify models of dynamical systems with multiple modes
having different DAE-based dynamics. However, the handling
of mode changes by the current Modelica tools is not
satisfactory. An important difficulty is the occurrence of
impulsive behavior at some mode changes, for some variables.
In this paper, we propose a compile-time algorithm
for identifying such impulsive behaviors and quantifying
them in terms of their magnitude orders. Such algorithm
can be used as an additional step of the structural analysis
of Modelica models.
Keywords: multimode DAE, structural analysis, impulsive
