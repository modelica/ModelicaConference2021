Abstract
Increased demand for customized products and reduced
manufacturing times are key drivers towards modern, automated
manufacturing systems. Manufacturing companies
increasingly rely on simulation models of their manufacturing
systems, with the goal to optimize critical production
parameters and programming of their industrial
assets. Simulation driven optimization concepts like digital
twin and virtual commissioning are gaining popularity
among manufacturing units to drive production rates
higher. Manufacturing systems in the aerospace domain
are highly complex, due to component size, tight tolerance
requirements, and multi-tier manufacturing processes.
Accurate simulations of robots and other programmable
assets are needed, in order to lower the risk of
collisions and manufacturing down times. In practice, this
leads to inhomogeneous and even proprietary simulation
environments, with different software interfaces. In this
paper we introduce an accurate robotic arm simulation for
industrial manufacturing robots that is based on open standards.
This simulation environment is based on two open
access standards, namely the Functional Mock-up Interface
(FMI) and the Distributed Co-Simulation Protocol
(DCP). In a virtualized manufacturing process the number
of involved stakeholders is significantly higher. Typically,
it includes software and simulation tool vendors, next to
the robotic system providers. Therefore a modular software
architecture based on open access standards is considered
beneficial. Due to the fact that passenger aircraft
are highly customized, frequent reprogramming of robotic
systems is needed. During these component manufacturing
processes the challenge is to maintain a high level of
accuracy and reliability.
