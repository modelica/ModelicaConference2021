Abstract

This paper presents the modelling of a synchronisation
control as used inside a typical hydro power controller
for small hydro power plants. It was built using
the open-source modelling language Modelica by use
of the Modelica Standard Library (Modelica Association
2019), the OpenIPSL (ALSETLab et al. 2018) and the
OpenHPL (TMCC 2019).
The resulting model allows for both transient and longterm
simulations for the complete hydro power system
with the main functions available and working. This includes
water-level control, frequency control, voltage control
with a power factor control and the synchronisation
sequence.
