Abstract

The open-source Modelica library TransiEnt Library was
developed within the research project TransiEnt.EE. This paper
presents two major library extensions which were developed in
the follow-up research project ResiliEntEE. Modeling of the
power sector on transmission grid level is now possible due to
the implementation of the complex bus voltage. In the gas
sector, the efficiency of mass and energy balance computation
was improved. Furthermore, an efficient physical pressure loss
model was added leading to more realistic results and faster
simulations. One possible application of the library is presented
in an exemplary simulation of an integrated energy system. It is
shown that the dynamic simulation allows the representation of
disturbances and their possible consequences in coupled sectors.
Thus, next to cost and CO2 emissions, an integrated energy
system can be assessed in terms of its resilience as well.
