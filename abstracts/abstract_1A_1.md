Abstract

The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) (Modelica Association
2021b) is a tool independent standard for the exchange
of dynamic models and for co-simulation. FMI
2.0, released in 2014, is recognized as the de-facto standard
in industry for exchanging models and tool coupling,
and is currently supported by more than 160 simulation
tools. Version 3.0 of the standard brings many new features
that allow for advanced co-simulation algorithms
and new use cases such as packaging and simulation of
highly accurate virtual Electronic Control Units (vECUs).
Besides Model-Exchange and Co-Simulation, a third interface
type, Scheduled Execution, is defined for purely
discrete, RTOS-like, simulation and supports preemption.
Clocks allow the synchronization of events between Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs) and the importer. There
is better support for data types including binary data and
arrays. Advanced co-simulation approaches are enabled
by intermediate variable access between communication
points and allowing event handling. The composition of
systems from FMUs is simplified by terminals that can
bundle multiple signals. The concept of layered standards
allows the extension of the FMI standard.
