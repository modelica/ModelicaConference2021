Abstract
Decarbonization of industry is a key challenge to achieve
the Paris climate goals. Digitalization of the industry is
a cornerstone of this journey. In this paper we present
our modelling work towards the creation of a Digital Energy
Twin of the energy supply system of a printed circuit
board manufacturing by means of a classical use case,
system design optimization. The simulation approach allowed
us to fairly compare the improvements done in the
energy supply system by evaluating those under the same
operating conditions. Integration of chiller’s waste heat
can cover most of the low temperature grid heat demand
while the additional generation of chilled water reduces
the amount of water pump from and back to the river.
