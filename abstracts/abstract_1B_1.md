Abstract

A new design of the Modia experimental modeling language
based on Julia is presented. It has simple yet powerful
syntax and semantics. A unified means of describing
the fundamental semantics, which is similar to Modelica,
is outlined. Furthermore, it is shown how domain
specific algorithms can be combined with equation based
modeling. It is demonstrated for multibody systems and
enables more efficient translation since much repetitive
analysis and transformations are avoided and faster simulation.
The drive train of a robot model was automatically
translated from Modelica to Modia. Modern simulation
algorithms from the Julia community allow working with
automatic differentiation and uncertainties.
