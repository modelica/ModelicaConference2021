Abstract

This paper introduces ScalableTestGrids, an open-source
and flexible benchmark suite for assessing the performance
of Modelica tools on large-scale power system test
cases. The benchmark suite is built by using components
from the PowerGrids library and generic utility scripts creating
the final runnable Modelica models. It does not
depend on confidential data; its structure makes any future
needed modification or evolution easy and straightforward.
Results obtained with the OpenModelica tool are
also reported. The benchmark suite can be used by tool
developers to assess the capability of their tools to handle
large-scale power generation and transmission models.
