Abstract
The new generation of LEO (Low Earth Orbit) communication
satellite constellations have the advantages of low
latency, strong signals, and global coverage. In order
to achieve global coverage, the LEO satellite constellations
are often very large, with a large number of satellites,
which puts forward high requirements for the overall
design, operation and maintenance of the constellation.
Based on the Modelica language, this paper conducts a
detailed study of the LEO communication satellite constellation
and built a system model of satellite constellation,
and carries out a full-link simulation for the typical
service of mobile communication. By analyzing the simulation
results, we conclude that based on the model of
satellite constellation proposed in the paper, the satellite
constellation can be quickly designed and simulated.
