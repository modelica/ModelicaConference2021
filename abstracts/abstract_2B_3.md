Abstract

A Modelica model of a of a rocket’s first stage is developed,
designed to be representative of the launch vehicles
in use in the United States in the late 2010s. The model
uses initial conditions similar to those observed immediately
after a second stage separation at 166 km altitude. A
control system is developed enabling the rocket first stage
to land back on Earth’s surface at a predetermined landing
pad in a controlled manner. The control system is evaluated
based on its ability to compensate for altered initial
conditions, as well as its ability to minimize acceleration
forces and fuel consumption. The flight path of the simulated
first stage rocket is compared to real-life telemetry
data from a first stage rocket landing showing a similar
trajectory.
