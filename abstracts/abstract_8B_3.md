Abstract

Non-residential buildings are accountable for 11% of
global energy-related CO2 emissions (United Nations Environment
Programme 2018). To increase the performance
in this sector, Building Energy Performance Simulation
(BEPS) is one feasible approach. Therefore, there is
need for reliable and fast simulation models. One feasible
approach are so called Reduced Order Models (ROMs).
Thus in this paper, a comparison between the results of the
established BEPS tool EnergyPlus and a ROM in Modelica
with a reduced number of resistances and capacities is
applied at the use case of a non-residential building. A
self-developed toolchain was used to create equal models
for ROM and EnergyPlus based on the same Building
Information Modeling (BIM) model. The comparison
shows that the reduced model deviates by ∼10%in annual
heating and cooling. To increase accuracy and decrease
computational effort the zoning strategy of non-residential
buildings is investigated. The investigation shows that using
a suitable zoning approach can reduce the computational
effort by up to 97 %.
