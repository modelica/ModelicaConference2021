General Purpose Lua Interpreter for Modelica
Fabian Buse1 Tobias Bellmann1

Abstract
Simulation becomes more and more important in the development
of complex systems. Modeled systems often
are comprised of mechanical, electrical as well as software
systems. It is often not possible to evaluate the performance
of a system without considering some higher
level logic anymore. Scripting languages, such as Lua,
are usually well suited to implement these logic elements.
This paper shows the integration of the Lua interpreter into
Modelica, and gives examples how the library can be used
to help with the simulation of industrial robots or in the
development of a planetary exploration rover in the MMX
Mission.
Keywords: Modelica, Lua, script language, robotics, finite
