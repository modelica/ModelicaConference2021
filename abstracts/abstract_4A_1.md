Abstract

This paper presents the simulation of electromagnetic
transients (EMTs) with Modelica. The advantages and
disadvantages are discussed. Simulation performance and
accuracy are analyzed through the IEEE 118-bus
benchmark which includes EMT-detailed models with
nonlinearities. The domain-specific simulator EMTP is
used for validations and comparisons.
