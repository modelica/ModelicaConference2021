Abstract
Energy production and consumption systems increasingly
require more flexibility. The design of new control solutions
can be a step, among others, towards flexibility.
However, these control solutions often rely on the use of
complex models, which are difficult to both manipulate
and simulate. This paper presents a proof of concept of a
method that reduces the complexity of multi-energy models
modeled with Modelica language. This complexityreducing
method is based on simplifying the model’s components
that contribute less to the total energy using an
energy-based ranking technique. The proposed solution is
successfully applied to a complex city district model. A
property of the Modelica language further allows redeclaration
of low-ranked components without being compelled
to fully redesign the model. Criteria verifying the
multi-energy reduced model’s precision, while respecting
physical constraints, are also introduced.
