Abstract

In data-driven bearing fault diagnosis, sufficient fault data
is fundamental for algorithm training and validation, however,
in most industry applications, only very few fault
measurements can be provided, which brings bearing dynamics
model as an alternative to produce bearing response
under defects. In this paper, a Modelica model for
the whole bearing test rig was built, including test bearing,
driving motor and hydraulic loading system. For the test
bearing, a 5 degree-of-freedom (5-DoF) model was proposed
to identify the normal bearing dynamics, and a fault
model was employed to characterize the defect position,
defect size, defect shape and multiple defects. Theory
and process to implement the virtual bearing test bench
in Modelica were detailed, and 3 cases were conducted to
validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
