Abstract
This paper gives an overview of the FMI 3.0 support
for two kinds of clock-based simulations: Synchronous
Clocked Simulation, and Scheduled Execution. The
former is used when the information about multiple simultaneous
events (cause and exact time of occurrence) can be
unambiguously conveyed. The later facilitates real-time
simulations comprising multiple black-box models, by allowing
fine grained control over the computation time of
sub-models. A formalization is presented along with example
application scenarios, meant as an introduction to
the conceptualization of clocks in the FMI Standard.
