## An Approach for Reducing Gas Turbines Usage by Wind Power and Energy Storage

**Nejm Saadallah, Yngve Heggelund**

Abstract

Offshore oil and gas platforms can accelerate their shift
towards lower greenhouse gases emissions by combining
wind power generation and energy storage systems. However,
the variability of the wind resources and power demand,
and the limited storage capacity make the design
of the system particularly challenging. We present a modelica
library at its early stage of the development and yet
with promising results. The model will be used to simulate
the dynamics of the whole system for a long period of time
using simplified power components and balanced micro
grid. This paper shares some preliminary results by applying
the model on a dataset of wind resources and power
demand from the North Sea. The results are the power system
dynamics and an approximation of the mass of greenhouse
gas emissions. On the long term the model will
be applied to determine the right control and optimization
strategy to control the energy system towards lower
greenhouse gas emissions without compromising the balance
between the power supply and demand.
