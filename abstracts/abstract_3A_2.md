Abstract

In this paper, the next generation of model-based visualization
is introduced, the DLR Visualization 2 Library.
This new real-time graphics environment for Modelica is
equipped with a state of the art engine for physics based
lighting calculation and high-definition render quality, simultaneous
visualization of parallel running simulation
models, new features like a modern streaming interface
and a new, cleaner library structure. It enables the user to
create graphical real-time environments for virtual commissioning
of complex systems of systems and imaging
based sensors. Some applications, as for example depthcamera
data generation or rendering of point clouds or
vectorized flow visualization are demonstrated in the use
cases section of this paper.
