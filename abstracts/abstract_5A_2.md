## Continuous Development and Management of Credible Modelica Models

**Leo Gall1 Martin Otter, Matthias Reiner, Matthias Sch√§fer, Jakub Tobolar**

Abstract

Modeling and simulation is increasingly used in the design
process for a wide span of applications. Rising demands
and the complexity of modern products also increases the
need for models and tools capable to cover areas such as
virtual testing, design-space exploration or digital twins,
and to provide measures of the quality of the models and
the achieved results. In this article, we try to summarize
the state-of-the-art and best-practice from the viewpoint of
a Modelica language user, based on the experience gained
in projects in which Modelica models have been utilized
in the design process. Furthermore, missing features and
gaps in the used processes are identified.
