## Towards a Modelica OPC UA Library for Industrial Automation

**Bernhard Thiele**

Abstract

Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture
(OPC UA) is often named as a prospective enabler for future
automation systems integrations, as for example envisioned
in the German Initiative Industrie 4.0. The DLR
OPC UA Modelica library connects OPC UA with the
Modelica world. There are two main goals: First, OPC
UA server capabilities for emulating the communication
interface of (physical) hardware components in order to
create component simulations, e.g., for virtual commissioning.
Second, OPC UA client capabilities for interacting
with real-world hardware components, e.g., for process
visualization and monitoring or interactive simulation
and control purposes. The library works on Windows and
Linux platforms. It is tested using the Modelica environments
Dymola and OpenModelica.
