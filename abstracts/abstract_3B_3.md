Abstract

In this paper, a Modelica library of electrified powertrain
components is presented and its applications discussed.
This library is used to construct digital twins of electrified
powertrains during product development. These digital
twins provide value by reducing development time and
cost, while once the product is in-service, they enable
improved condition monitoring. The library includes a
multi-fidelity and multi-scale battery and power
electronics sub-library, an Electrical Drive Unit (EDU)
sub-library modelling different types of electrical
machines, and an electrified propulsion system sub-library
of template models that leverage the battery, power
electronics and EDU components found in the other sublibraries.
Finally, an example of applying the proposed
library to electrified vehicle development is presented.
