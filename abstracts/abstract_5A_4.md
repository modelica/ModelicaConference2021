Abstract
The design process of buildings and energy supply
systems consists of several steps with increasing accuracy
and decreasing fault tolerance. Because of a wide range of
unknowns and increasing complexity, Modelica models
are often an integral part of the first design steps.
However, there are only rare updates and reuse of these
models in later phases and/or during building use.
This paper emphasizes the potential of a continuous
update and use of available Modelica models during all
steps of building design processes. It therefore regards an
example of a research greenhouse building for which the
initially developed Modelica models were continuously
updated and reused during the final phase of intensive
scientific monitoring. Furthermore, general insights in
latest scientific approaches indicate suitable steps of
partly-automated continuous model updates during the
whole building life span using BIM (Building Information
Modeling).
