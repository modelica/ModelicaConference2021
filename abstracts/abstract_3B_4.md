Abstract

This paper describes the development process of a test bed
for an interactive VR (virtual reality) environment for
indoor climate simulations of buildings. The basic idea is
to reproduce the simulated indoor climate of a thermal
room model in a climate chamber with the help of air
conditioning devices and thus to make the indoor climate
directly physically experienceable for a user in real-time.
In a first step, the real test bed is mapped with the help of
a digital twin and simulated in parallel with the room
model. In a second step, the digital twin is replaced by the
real test bed and the Modelica room model is included
then as an embedded model. In this way, the real test bed
can be operated with the control algorithm which has been
evaluated and optimized in a previous step. The described
approach is demonstrated in a case study using a simple
single-zone building model.
