Abstract
The development and simulation of engineering systems,
especially wind turbines, is becoming increasingly
complex and elaborate. At the Fraunhofer Institute for
Wind Energy Systems (IWES), the in-house tool MoWiT
(Modelica library for Wind Turbines) is being developed
for load simulation. MoWiT is based on the modeling
language Modelica and is constantly evolving. It is, thus,
also becoming more and more enhanced. This results in
an increased need for automation for the complex
simulation setups and a need for quality assurance of
simulation code used. Test automation is used to always
ensure the quality of the code. The automation of various
simulations and the test automation for the load simulation
code are provided by PyWiT (Python Framework for
Wind Turbines), which will be presented here in more
detail.
