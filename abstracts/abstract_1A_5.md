Abstract

This paper summarizes the final research results of the
ITEA3 project EMPHYSIS (embedded systems with
physical models in the production code software). Its core
achievement is the new open eFMI Standard enabling
automated workflows from high-level mathematical
models of physical systems (referred to as physical
models) to automotive compliant embedded software.
eFMI (FMI for embedded systems) defines a container
architecture for model exchange and testing. Multiple
representations from an intermediate representation of
sampled algorithms (GALEC) to production and binary
code for specific embedded targets are maintained in a
traceable workspace. The successful integration of the
developed eFMI tooling is demonstrated by a
comprehensive open source Modelica test cases library
and industrial demonstrators. The readiness of the
proposed approach is proven by compliance checks
according to common automotive code quality standards
like MISRA C:2012 and a performance benchmark in
terms of runtime and resource demand in comparison with
state-of-the-art hand coded solutions.
