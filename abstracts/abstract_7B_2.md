Abstract

Highly compact micro nuclear reactors which have
broad energy advantages in the application of ocean,
land, space, and sky, become a hot research topic in
the international nuclear industry recently. In this
paper, Modelica language was used in the system
modeling and simulation of a micro gas-cooled
reactor. The Modelica model was self-developed by
China Nuclear Power Engineering Company and the
MWorks developed by Suzhou Tongyuan was
chosen as the simulation platform. Two simulations
of a concept micro gas-cooled reactor design were
carried out. One is the extreme accident scenario and
the other is a normal load-following operation. The
simulation results showed that the reactor has good
inherent safety even under the extreme accident, in
which the reactor shutdown can be achieved only by
the negative reactivity result from the increase of core
temperature and the fuels were not damaged since the
decay heat was removed by passive air cooling from
outside of the reactor pressure vessel. The reactor
also has good load-following performance, which
can be achieved by simply adjusting the helium
inventory (or pressure) and the control rod position,
while the core temperature and power generation
efficiency kept constant.
