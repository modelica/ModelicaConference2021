## The Potential of FMI for the Development of Digital Twins for Large Modular Multi-Domain Systems

**Marcus Wiens, Tobias Meyer, Philipp Thomas**

Abstract
Digital twins enable the observation, prediction, and
optimization of a physical system and thus allow to realize
their full potential. However, their functionality is mainly
based on simulation models of the entire system behavior.
For modular multi-domain systems, this requires the
extensive use of dynamically composed models that are
made up of individual component models. The FMIStandard
forms a solid foundation for this problem and is
very well known in the automotive engineering fields.
However, composed system models using FMI are not
widely adapted in renewable energy and wind energy yet.
So far, the coupling of simulation models is limited. This
paper discusses the strategy of building digital twins from
individual FMUs with predefined model interfaces based
on an ontology for renewable energy systems. An
accelerated development is enabled by the exchange of
sub-models in the digital twin without adjustments of
interface. An example for the proposed process is given
by the composed simulation model of a hydrogen
generation process based on wind energy.
