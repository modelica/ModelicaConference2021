A Graph-Based Meta-Data Model for DevOps in
Simulation-Driven Development and Generation of DCP
Configurations

Abstract
To improve the quality of model-based development and
to reduce testing effort DevOps practices gain more and
more importance. However, most system engineers are
not DevOps specialists and there are a lot of manual steps
involved when writing build pipelines and configurations
of simulations. For this purpose, an abstract graph-based
meta-data model is proposed. This allows auto-generation
of scenario descriptions for the DCP standard and code
for the build server where the simulation is set up and
executed. A simple use case is described as an example
of how this could be applied in practice. Furthermore, a
Python implementation of a DCP master and a simple FMI
to DCP wrapper are presented in this work.
