Abstract

In the light of the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic, the dispersion
process of respiratory droplets released by potentially
infected persons has been investigated in many studies
using highly reliable but time consuming CFD methods.
With such simulations social distancing, wearing masks
and shifts in ventilation systems could be justified. This
work focuses on the same topic but uses the validated
Velocity Propagating Zonal Model (VEPZO) instead of
CFD simulations. It is implemented in Modelica and
allows fast simulation of the indoor environment on a
coarse grid which in many cases is a superior alternative
to complex CFD simulations in the trade-off between
effort and detail of the result. Based on the temperature
and airflow distribution, this model can be used to
predict the dispersion of aerosols in enclosed spaces and
thus the relative risk of Covid-19 infection. For model
verification, a documented outbreak in a restaurant in
Guangzhou is being investigated. An improved
ventilation pattern to contain viral load more locally is
developed.
