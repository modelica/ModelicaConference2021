Abstract

This paper investigates steady-state initialization both
symbolically and numerically, and in particular
demonstrates new ways of adapting the symbolic methods
for finding steady-state solutions for Modelica models
extending ideas that were previously manually
implemented in libraries. The methods are compared on
realistic Modelica models in Dymola.
