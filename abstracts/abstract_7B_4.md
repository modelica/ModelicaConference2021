Abstract

District cooling (DC) continues to proliferate due to increasing
global cooling demands and economies of scale
benefits; however, most district-scale modeling has focused
on heating, and to the best of our knowledge, researchers
have yet to model cooling plants featuring waterside
economizers in DC settings. With the Modelica
Buildings library expanding its capabilities to district
scale, this study is one of the first to demonstrate how
the open-source models can be used for detailed energy
and control analysis of a DC plant. For a real-world case
study, we developed and validated high-fidelity models for
a DC central plant at a college campus in Colorado, USA,
and we optimized the condenser water supply temperature
(CWST) setpoint across multiple time horizons using
the Optimization library in Dymola. Results indicate
that annual CWST optimization saves 4.7% annual plant
energy, with less than 1% of additional energy savings
gained through daily optimization. This confirms previous
studiesâ€™ findings that high frequency CWST optimizations
are not necessary for the studied system.
