Abstract

This paper describes the modeling and simulation of the
RespiraWorks ventilator in Modelica with Modelon
Impact and the Pneumatics Library. Following a brief
overview of the RespiraWorks open-source effort in
response to COVID-19, details of the pneumatic modeling
effort, including the implementation of new components,
are provided in support of the model-based development
process. The pneumatics models of several different
iterations of the ventilator design are shown. Lastly an
overview of the model calibration process is provided, and
the model results are compared with experimental data
collected from the ventilator prototype.
