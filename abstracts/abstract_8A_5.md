Abstract
As the world is moving towards renewable energy
sources for sustainable energy, concentrated solar
power (CSP) systems with thermal energy storage
present significant opportunities for generating
electricity. This paper describes an effort to develop an
analytic platform for Brayton cycle and connect it to
central receiver CSP system to form a complete
system. Already analytical model for central receiver
CSP system with Rankine cycle was already developed
and available with Modelon (Edman, 2015; Windahl,
2015). This paper describes the development of a
supercritical CO2 recompression Brayton cycle based
on the information available in the literature (Dennis,
2017). The effect of change in turbine inlet temperature
on the performance and efficiency of Brayton cycle are
shown. Integration of Brayton cycle with CSP system
is done and the solar power requirement based on
turbine inlet temperatures is studied.
