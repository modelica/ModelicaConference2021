Abstract

This paper introduces a new library for the manipulation
and assembly of 3D objects using Modelica. The method
is based on collision detection, contact dynamics, position
and orientation control as well as states for object manipulation.
The aim is a stable and efficient simulation of
these processes close to real physics. 3D objects (both elementary
shapes and CAD objects) can be added from the
library browser to a model by drag-and-drop and are directly
capable of being manipulated by multiple grippers
and conveyors or being assembled to an assembly. This
allows a high degree of flexibility and the modeling effort
can be decreased significantly.

*Keywords: manipulation, grasping, gripper, assembly, collision detection, contact dynamics, state machine*
