## Object-Oriented Models of Parallel Manipulators

**Paolo Campanini, Gianni Ferretti**

Abstract

In this paper, the development of models of parallel manipulator
is described, based on components of the Modelica
standard library only. At first, the dynamic model
of a Delta robot is illustrated and validated with respect
to experimental data. Then, the model of a Stewart platform
is discussed. Thanks to the symbolic manipulation
capabilities of the OpenModelica compiler, the model is
then used to automatically generate the inverse dynamics,
which is in general is a quite difficult task.
