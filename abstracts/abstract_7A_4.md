Numerically Robust Six-Equation Two-Phase Flow Model
for Stationary and Moving Systems in Modelica
Johannes Brunnemann1 Ales Vojacek1 Thomas Koch1

Abstract
We present a physics based Modelica finite volume flow
model that separately balances vapour and liquid phase.
By using extensive state variables and a special mass flow
regularisation, the model can cope with the possible vanishing
or emerging of a phase in a numerically robust way.
Although at prototype stage, the model already exhibits
all required capabilities. These are demonstrated in feature
testers and in a model of a natural convection driven
cooling cycle operating under external acceleration forces.
