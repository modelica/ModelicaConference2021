Abstract

Based on the Thermal Runaway (TR) experiments conducted
in our laboratory a simple method of describing
a battery’s thermal behaviour was developed. In
the approach - which we call simple tracing method -
the temperature rate measurement from Accelerating Rate
Calorimetry (ARC) during a TR experiment is approximated
to determine the thermal behaviour of the model.
This method was implemented in Modelica using Dymola.
Alongside the implementation of the TR model a complete
Modelica package with useful models for TR propagation
simulation was developed. The package called
“BatterySafety” serves as a foundation for further model
development to investigate TR propagation and physical
counter measures in greater detail. The focus of all the
models in the package was efficiency, intelligibility and
user-friendliness. With this approach we are able to simulate
TR propagation of a complete battery pack.
