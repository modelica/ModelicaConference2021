Abstract
This paper presents the open-source implementation in
Modelica of the generic photovoltaics and wind turbine
generator models introduced by the Western Electricity
Coordinating Counsil (WECC) Renewable Energy Modeling
Task Force. These dynamic models have been designed
to be easily understandable and reusable by adopting
the same decomposition as in the original WECC
reports. It uses as much as possible existing Modelica
Standard Library blocks and extends common parts
whenever possible. The simulation results obtained with
OpenModelica1 and Dynawo 2 - an hybrid C++/Modelica
open source suite of simulation tools for power systems - have been successfully validated against different reference
tools.
