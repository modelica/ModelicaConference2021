Abstract

This paper covers two major subjects: First, the presentation
of a new open-source library called FMI.jl for integrating
FMI into the Julia programming environment by
providing the possibility to load, parameterize and simulate
FMUs. Further, an extension to this library called
FMIFlux.jl is introduced, that allows the integration of
FMUs into a neural network topology to obtain a NeuralFMU.
This structural combination of an industry typical
black-box model and a data-driven machine learning
model combines the different advantages of both modeling
approaches in one single development environment.
This allows for the usage of advanced data driven modeling
techniques for physical effects that are difficult to
model based on first principles.
