Abstract

The emergence of Cyber-Physical Systems poses new
challenges for traditional modelling and simulation techniques.
We need to combine white, grey, and black box
models as well as different tools developed for specific
subsystems and domains. Co-simulation is a promising
approach to modeling and simulating such systems. This
paper presents a case study where a physical model of a
building’s heating system implemented in Modelica is cosimulated
with a machine learning model of a stratified
hot water tank implemented in Python. The Python model
is exported as Functional Mock-up Unit using UniFMU.
