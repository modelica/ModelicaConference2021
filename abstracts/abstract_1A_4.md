Abstract
LOng Time Archiving and Retrieval (LOTAR) of models
is key to using the full capabilities of model-Based
System Engineering (mBSE) in a system lifecycle –
including certification. The LOTAR MBSE workgroup is
writing the EN/NAS 9300-Part 520 to standardize the
associated process, in the aeronautics industry, and
suggests the usage of Modelica, FMI and SSP standards
for its purpose. Acceptance of such a process requires a
match between industrial needs and software vendor
implementations. This is helped by a tool-agnostic
implementation of the process and following specific
adaptations within the Modelon Impact software. This
initiative – inside the LOTAR workgroups – highlights
the suitability of such a process but also points at flaws
or overhead due to the lack of connection between the
Modelica, FMI and SSP standards, as well as the
MoSSEC (ISO 10303-243) standard. The
recommendations proposed in this document could have
a significant impact on the final adoption of the LOTAR
standard – relying on Modelica, FMI and SSP standards.
