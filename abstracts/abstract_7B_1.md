Abstract
Vapour compression machines such as heat pumps and
chillers are vital for achieving climate goals. Efficiency
of both depend mostly on system integration. In order
to simulate coupled energy systems, fast and stable simulation
models are required. Hence, we implement an
open-source model for reversible vapour compression machines.
The black-box based refrigeration cycle is replaceable,
additional inertia and losses are optional. Furthermore,
we model relevant safety controls of vapour compression
machines. To show validity of the presented approach,
we first calibrate two different black-box models
onto measured heat pump data. The table-based model fits
both measured temperature and power with minimal calibration
effort. Second, we show influences of different
model options onto coupled building performance simulations.
Computation time increases up to 50% when enabling
all model options. Simultaneously, seasonal efficiency
decreases by up to 23% when modeling all safety
controls. Keywords: Heat Pump, Chiller, Modular Model
