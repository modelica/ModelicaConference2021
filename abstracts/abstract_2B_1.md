## Aircraft Mission Simulation with the updated FlightDynamics Library
**Marc May, Reiko Müller, Gertjan Looye**

Abstract

Aircraft mission simulation plays an essential role during
the simulative design process of aircraft systems. An important
task is to conduct analyses for total aircraft assemblies
in different flight phases and also to produce performance
metrics in Multidisciplinary Design Optimization
(MDO) loops. Based on DLR’s FLIGHTDYNAMICS, the
library presented in this paper introduces mission simulation
capability for aerial and on-ground movement. For instance,
this includes flight control and management functions,
a detailed aircraft implementation including several
subsystems (for example landing gears, actuation and sensor
systems), and the application of the integrated setup to
realistic use-cases.
