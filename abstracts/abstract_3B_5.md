Abstract

The TCP-100 parabolic trough collectors (PTC) research
facility at Plataforma Solar de Almería (CIEMAT) has
been specially designed for the development of research
activities in Automatic Control of PTC solar thermal
power plants. The development of advanced control techniques
for this kind of facilities requires dynamic models
that should be successfully used in advanced controllers.
An important part of these models is the thermal losses
submodel, that traditionally has been considered as an experimental
steady state correlation. In this paper, a work
in progress about a first principles based model of the
losses to the environment of a parabolic trough collector
is presented, based on the physical phenomena inside
any parabolic trough collector during the operation of the
TCP-100 solar field. Concerning this model, the main
contribution of the paper is to include the dependence of
the air velocity close to the PTC. The implementation of
the model in the Modelica language has been done prioritizing
the use of the Modelica Standard Library classes.
Some simulations results of this model with theoretical
parameters values under typical operating conditions of
the TCP-100 plant are presented, showing higher losses
to the environment when compared with the information
provided by the TCP-100 manufacturer.
