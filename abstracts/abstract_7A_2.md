Abstract
Since its 3.3 release, Modelica offers the possibility to
specify models of dynamical systems with multiple modes
having different DAE-based dynamics. However, the handling
of such models by the current Modelica tools is not
satisfactory, with mathematically sound models yielding
exceptions at runtime. In this article, we propose a systematic
way of rewriting a multimode Modelica model,
based on the results of an already implemented multimode
structural analysis. The rewritten Modelica model is guaranteed
to be correctly compiled by state-of-the-art Modelica
tools. Simulation results are presented on a simple,
yet meaningful, physical system whose original Modelica
model is not correctly handled by state-of-the-art Modelica
tools.
