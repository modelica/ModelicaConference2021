For any questions regarding the program please contact modelica2021@groups.liu.se. 


- The conference sessions will be via Zoom – scientific paper sessions have 2 parallel tracks, tutorials and vendor sessions will depend on the final number of presentations
- Presenters can pre-record and upload a video until 18/09 or present live if they wish, the live videos will be recorded and all the videos will be uploaded to the MA Youtube channel a week after the conference
- Scientific track presentations are 15 minutes long + 5 minutes questions and industrial track presentations are 20 minutes long + 5 minutes for questions
- The conference page will be available via a private link sent to registered participants one week before the conference. It will contain the program with information about the presentations (author, title abstract), clickable links to Zoom sessions where the papers will be presented and clickable links to uploaded presentation videos.
- Discussions of presentations are like a “restricted” online meeting: A conference participant will raise their hand (click the hand button in zoom), a moderator moves one after the other to the panel, and the people in the panel can talk to each other, while the rest of the audience is listening.
- Gold sponsors can set up a virtual booth that will be linked on the conference page and that will be advertised at the beginning of the conference – booths are set up by the sponsors in the software of their choice and people will be directed to them via a link from the conference page and from the breakroom
- The breaks will be run using wonder.me an app where you can move around in a virtual hall and when you come closer to people conversations with them open
- The gold sponsors will have a dedicated space in the breakroom as well to discuss with participants and direct them to their virtual booths (by sending a link in the chat)
