### Tutorials on Monday

# Room A: FMI in the Cloud
Torsten, Sommer
In this tutorial we will take our FMUs into the cloud. After a short introduction to FMPy, an FMI library for Python, we create a Jupyter Notebook and learn how to upload resources, inspect and simulate an FMU, and to plot and download the simulation results. In the second part we write a web app and learn how to serve a web page, add input elements and finally to run a simulation on the server and to present the output. The third part is a hackathon and Q&A where you can build your own web app.

# Room B : Introduction to Modeling, Simulation, Debugging, and Interoperability with Modelica and OpenModelica 
Peter Fritzson
This tutorial gives an introduction to the Modelica language, the OpenModelica environment, and an overview of modeling and simulation in a number of application areas. Some advanced features of OpenModelica will be presented. A number of hands-on exercises will be done during the tutorial, both graphical modeling using the Modelica standard library and textual modeling. Bring your laptop for exercises.

# Room C : Modelica Buildings Library
David Blum
The Modelica Buildings Library is a free open-source library with dynamic simulation models for building and district energy and control systems.  Its development is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy.  This tutorial will overview the library, present modeling best-practices for thermo-fluid systems, and guide the attendees through hands-on exercises.

# Room D: Introduction to Modelica with Modelon Impact
Hubertus Tummescheit	
This workshop will give an introduction to Modelica with a focus on model users. We present the principles of modeling with Modelica and efficient use of libraries using multi-domain examples to make the workshop attractive for engineers from all branches of engineering. Simulations will be run on Modelon's cloud-native Modelica platform, Modelon Impact. Expected experience: some familiarity with system simulation. Requirements: Laptop with recent version of Google Chrome or Opera, 8GB of memory!


# Room E: Energy and thermal management of an electrical vehicle
Bruno Jofret
This tutorial illustrates how to build an electrical vehicle, from the chassis, the driveline, the energy supply, up to the thermal management of the systems, in order to evaluate the performance of the thermal management system, and its impact on the battery state of charge. It demonstrates how to use available components to create high level or detailed models for battery and driveline, as well as a step by step tutorial for building and sizing the thermal management.![image]


### Vendor sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday

# Wolfram System Modeler and Virtual Labs
The latest version of System Modeler will be presented as well as the free Virtual Labs for high schools and colleges.


# Using FMI for transient heat transfer simulation of 1D system models and TAITherm 3D thermal models
FMI system models can be combined with the TAITherm 3D transient thermal solver, which simulates detailed radiation, conduction, and convection.  The TAITherm 3D thermal models increase the solution accuracy by including complex 3D thermal effects and the FMI system models provide system level boundary conditions.  This combined approach can be run at near real-time speeds to allow digital prototyping and comprehensive transient simulation for thermal applications.

# Maplesoft: MapleSim 2021
MapleSim is a Modelica-based platform that combines system-level modeling and simulation with powerful analytic capabilities. Our goal with MapleSim is to provide engineers with an easy to use tool for design exploration and simulation. This session will be an overview of some of the unique features of MapleSim, as well as an update on the latest software enhancements.

# Dynawo : an hybrid C++/Modelica open-source suite of simulation tools for power systems
This presentation will introduce the motivations, main features, state of progress and perspectives of the Dynawo tool. This tool is based on an extensive use of the Modelica language for the modeling side combined with a dedicated approach to avoid/limit compilation at run-time and advanced top-of-the art open-source solvers. It enables to preserve the advantages of the Modelica language while offering industrially-grade performances for power system simulations.

# Modelon Impact - System Simulation for Everyone
Modelon Impact is a radically different system design engineering simulation software. Bring the power of decision-making to everyone in your organization. Modelon's product Manager for Modelon Impact, Johan WIndahl, will present all aspects of the cloud-native system simulation platform, with a focus on the latest features and an outlook on Modelon's product roadmap.

# Dassault Systèmes Vendor Session
You will discover the latest evolutions and perspectives regarding Dymola and underlying technologies as well as associated web applications and portfolio of libraries. Included: Dedicated section for latest standard support and examples of workflows involving other parts of Dassault Systèmes offer.

# Implementing multi-fmu simulation with a cosimulation platform
In our presentation we will discuss the benefits of native co-simulation to prepare FMU’s;we will define some prerequisite to export and run an FMU using commerciallyavailable simulator; we will guide the integration of FMU to co-simulation platform;finally, we will underline the advantages of FMUs for co-simulation and DistributedCosimulation.

# Distributed Co-simulation Platform - VenetDCP!
VenetDCP is a distributed co-simulation platform which enables to connect model and tools owned by separate teams and companies over the internet. VenetDCP generates FMI adapters for tool coupling. These adapters can be imported into FMI compliant tools to build up distributed co-simulation environment instantly. This presentation shows the challenges, technology and industrial applications of model exchange and co-simulation.
