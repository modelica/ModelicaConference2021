## Call for Papers (December 1st  â€“ ~~April 26~~ May 10)

Papers can be submitted for full presentation or for poster presentation. In addition, new free Modelica libraries can be introduced to the public. The Modelica Free Library Award will be given to the best and second best free libraries submitted for review. Modelica Association members (excluding selection committee members) can apply for this award too.

You are encouraged to submit a full paper of 4-10 pages. Please see the [Call-for-Papers page](call2021.md) for further information about the submission and/or application process and the submission templates. All submitted papers will be peer-reviewed by the Conference Program Committee (3 reviews per paper).

The conference proceedings will be published electronically. After the conference, the proceedings will be available online. Authors keep the copyright for their papers and just provide non-exclusive publication rights to the Modelica Association.

## Call for Industrial User Presentations

During the conference two sessions are planned for Industrial User Presentations related to existing and possibly new Modelica Association projects.
You must submit an extended abstract of 1-2 pages for a presentation-only contribution. Please see the Call-for-Papers page for further information about the submission and/or application process. The abstracts will be peer-reviewed by experts, but no papers will be published in the conference proceedings.

Please note that purely tool-related presentations are not permitted for these application-oriented presentations, they should be covered by vendor sessions.

## Call for Tutorials, Vendor Sessions & Sponsors

During the Modelica 2021 Conference tutorials and vendor sessions will be held.

For more information, please check the  [Other Calls](othercalls.md)  page.

Sponsors are also welcome to host virtual exhibition booths - virtual conference/chat rooms that they will set up and staff during conference hours.
Links to these booths will be available via the program page. The vendors are in charge of setting up the booths themselves in the tool of their choice.


We are sure you will be interested in gaining visibility to the Modelica community, especially since this year with free virtual participation we expect a larger attendance than usual.
Therefore we have prepared 2 different Sponsor packages as well as tool vendor sessions and tutorials.

For more information, please check the [Other Calls](othercalls.md) page.
