<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) (Modelica Association 2021[b]) is a tool independent standard for the exchange of dynamic models and for co-simulation.  FMI2.0, released in 2014, is recognized as the de-facto standard in industry for exchanging models and tool coupling,and is currently supported by more than 160 simulation tools. Version 3.0 of the standard brings many new features that allow  for  advanced co-simulation  algorithms and new use cases such as packaging and simulation of highly accurate virtual Electronic Control Units (vECUs). Besides Model-Exchange and Co-Simulation, a third interface type, Scheduled Execution, is defined for purely discrete, RTOS-like, simulation and supports preemption.Clocks allow the synchronization of events between Functional  Mock-up Units (FMUs)  and  the  importer. There is better support for data types including binary data and arrays.   Advanced co-simulation approaches are enabled by intermediate variable access between communication points and allowing event handling. The composition of systems from  FMUs is simplified by terminals that can bundle multiple signals. The concept of layered standards allows the extension of the FMI standard.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper gives an overview of the FMI 3.0 support for two kinds of clock-based simulations: Synchronous Clocked Simulation, and Scheduled Execution.
The former is used when the information about multiple simultaneous events (cause and exact time of occurrence) can be unambiguously conveyed.
The later facilitates real-time simulations comprising multiple black-box models, by allowing fine grained control over the computation time of sub-models.
A formalization is presented along with example application scenarios, meant as an introduction to the conceptualization of clocks in the FMI Standard.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Establishing interoperability is an essential aspect in the often pursued shift towards Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) of, for example, aircraft. If models are to be the primary information carriers during development, the applied methods to enable interaction between engineering domains need to be modular, reusable, and
scalable. One possible solution is to rely on available open-source tools and standards. In this paper, the standards Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) and System
Structure and Parameterization (SSP) are exploited to exchange data between the disciplines of systems simulation and geometry modeling. A method to export data from
the 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) Software (SW) CATIA in the SSP format is developed and presented. Analogously, FMI support of the Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) tools OMSimulator, OpenModelica, and Dymola are utilized along with the SSP support of OMSimulator. The developed technology is put into context by means of integration with M&amp;S methodology for aircraft vehicle system development deployed at Saab Aeronautics. Finally, the established interoperability is demonstrated in an industrially relevant use-case. A primary goal of the research is to prototype and demonstrate functionality, enabled by the SSP and FMI standards, that could improve on MBSE methodology implemented in industry and academia.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>LOng Time Archiving and Retrieval (LOTAR) of models is key to using the full capabilities of model-Based System Engineering (mBSE) in a system lifecycle – including certification. The LOTAR MBSE workgroup is writing the EN/NAS 9300-Part 520 to standardize the associated process, in the aeronautics industry, and suggests the usage of Modelica, FMI and SSP standards for its purpose. Acceptance of such a process requires a match between industrial needs and software vendor implementations. This is helped by a tool-agnostic implementation of the process and following specific adaptations within the Modelon Impact software. This initiative – inside the LOTAR workgroups – highlights the suitability of such a process but also points at flaws or overhead due to the lack of connection between the Modelica, FMI and SSP standards, as well as the MoSSEC (ISO 10303-243) standard. The recommendations proposed in this document could have a significant impact on the final adoption of the LOTAR standard – relying on Modelica, FMI and SSP standards.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper summarizes the final research results of the ITEA3 project EMPHYSIS (embedded systems with physical models in the production code software). Its core achievement is the new open eFMI Standard enabling new automated workflows from high level physical models to automotive compliant embedded software. eFMI (FMI for embedded systems) defines a container architecture for model exchange, testing and automatic model transformations. Multiple representations from a high-level intermediate representation of sampled algorithms (GALEC) to production and binary code for specific embedded targets are maintained in a traceable workspace. The successful integration of the developed eFMI tooling is demonstrated by a comprehensive open source Modelica test cases library and industrial demonstrators. The readiness of the proposed approach is proven by compliance checks according to common automotive code quality standards (MISRA) and a performance benchmark in terms of runtime and resource demand in comparison with state of the art hand coded solutions.</td></tr>
