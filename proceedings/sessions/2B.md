<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>In this paper, aircraft mission simulation in Modelica with multidisciplinary models is described. This includes for example a Flight Control System (FCS) accompanied by a Flight Management System (FMS), a detailed aircraft implementation including several subsystems (for example landing gears, actuation and sensor systems), and the application of the integrated setup to realistic mission scenarios.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The new generation of LEO (Low Earth Orbit) communication satellite constellations have the advantages of low latency, strong signals, and global coverage. In order to achieve global coverage, the LEO satellite constellations are often very large, with a large number of satellites, which puts forward high requirements for the overall design, operation and maintenance of the constellation. Based on the Modelica language, this paper conducts a detailed study of the LEO communication satellite constellation and built a system model of satellite constellation, and carries out a full-link simulation for the typical service of mobile communication. By analyzing the simulation results, we conclude that based on the model of satellite constellation proposed in the paper, the satellite constellation can be quickly designed and simulated.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>A Modelica model of a of a rocket&#x27;s first stage is developed, designed to be representative of the launch vehicles in use in the United States in the late 2010s. The model uses initial conditions similar to those observed immediately after a second stage separation at 166km altitude. A control system is developed enabling the rocket first stage to land back on Earth&#x27;s surface at a predetermined landing pad in a controlled manner. The control system is evaluated based on its ability to compensate for altered initial conditions, as well as its ability to minimize acceleration forces and fuel consumption. The flight path of the simulated first stage rocket is compared to real-life telemetry data from a first stage rocket landing showing a similar trajectory.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Energy storage systems have been gaining attention as a means of load management in grid-interactive efficient buildings. This study investigated the physics of the ice storage tank (IST) and implemented an IST model in Modelica. The developed IST Modelica model was compared with a similar model in EnergyPlus and was validated against experimental data from a testbed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Three statistical performance metrics were used to quantify the accuracy of the IST model. Validation results (CV(RMSE) ≤ 10.20 %, NMBE ≤ 0.44 %) show that the proposed model has a good prediction accuracy according to ASHRAE Guideline 14.</td></tr>
