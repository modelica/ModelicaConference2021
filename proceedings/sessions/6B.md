<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The understanding of routs of disease transmission is crucial for getting the outbreak of the novel Sars-CoV-2 virus under control. At the beginning of the year 2020 much attention has been paid on person-to-person transmission, whereas now there is more debate and also evidence of airborne transmission. The dispersion process of respiratory droplets released by potentially infected persons has been investigated in many studies using highly reliable but time consuming CFD methods. With such simulations social distancing, wearing masks and shifts in ventilation systems could be justified. This work focuses on the same topic but uses validated zonal models instead of CFD simulations. The Indoor Environment Simulation Suite (IESS) is a toolbox of different sub models for the fast simulation of the indoor environment on a coarse grid. It is implemented in Modelica and at its heart is the Velocity Propagating Zonal model (VEPZO) which in many cases is a superior alternative to complex CFD simulations in terms of the trade-off between effort and detail of the result. Based on the temperature and airflow distribution, this model can be used to predict the dispersion of aerosols in enclosed spaces and thus to infer the risk of Covid-19 infection. Therefore an example of an outbreak in a restaurant in Guangzhou is being investigated. With the installed ventilation system the infection of nine people could be reconstructed. Furthermore different variants were investigated as to how the dispersion area of the infectious aerosols could have been kept more locally concentrated. The local age of the air and the area of increased load with infectious aerosols were evaluated.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper describes the modeling and simulation of the RespiraWorks ventilator in Modelica with Modelon Impact and the Pneumatics Library.  Following a brief overview of the RespiraWorks open-source effort in response to COVID-19, details of the pneumatic modeling effort, including the implementation of new components,  are provided in support of the model-based development process.  The pneumatics models of several different iterations of the ventilator design are shown.  Lastly an overview of the model calibration process is provided, and the model results are compared with experimental data collected from the ventilator prototype.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>There is a lack of Modeling and Simulation software systems in the bioscience arena that give both solutions compliant with current methodologies in drug discovery (pharmaceutic) and precision medicine (healthcare) ﬁelds, besides to support the addition of new biological mecha- nisms under a multilevel and multiformalism perspective, without penalize strongly the model sharing and reusing. A novel modeling and simulation software that tries to ﬁll the previous gap has been designed (CybSim) and it is presented in this work. CybSim is a platform for multilevel modeling of physiological - cybernetic sys- tems, compliant but not limited to Physiologically based- , Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PK/PD) methodologies. This capability is governed through the Physiological Scope setting value. The main physiologi- cal components are mechanistic. The underlying mechanisms may be changed during the model building thanks to the separation between mechanisms and physiological instances. This capability is based on a multilayer design. A preliminary version of CybSim has been implemented with OpenModelica (v1.14.1). A PBPK semiphysiological model published previously has been built as a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of CybSim. The accuracy of CybSim was veriﬁed during preliminary development phases. The two pointed out capabilities of CybSim demanded an object-oriented and acausal equation- based modeling language, able to support classes’ redeclaration, connectors’ causality, inner/outer scoping control and packages organization. These features are not supported by other modern acausal equation-based modeling languages like the EcosimPro language</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Decarbonization of industry is a key challenge to achieve the Paris climate goals. Digitalization of the industry is a cornerstone of this journey. In this paper we present our modelling work towards the creation of a Digital Energy Twin of the energy supply system of a printed boarding circuit manufacturing by means of a classical use case, system design optimization. The simulation approach allowed us to fairly compare the improvements done in the energy supply system by evaluating those under the same operating conditions. Integration of waste chiller’s waste heat can cover most of the low temperature grid heat demand while the additional generation of chilled water reduces the amount of water pump from and back to the river.</td></tr>
