<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The primary task of co-simulation is the synchronization and exchange of data between the subsystems, e.g., FMUs, at certain coupling points. If the FMUs have different step sizes, the synchronization of the FMUs is often at the expense of the simulation duration of the co-simulation. The presented parallel fast scheduling algorithm is an effective approach to couple FMUs with different coupling step sizes. Therefore, synchronization intervals are introduced in which FMUs that finish their coupling step are synchronized. This allows a high performance of the coupling in terms of simulation duration. The higher performance compared to other scheduling algorithms is particularly evident in real-time applications, i.e., HiL simulations. However, the synchronization intervals are defined via a synchronization step size, which can be set independently to the coupling step sizes of the FMUs. This additional step size has a significant impact on the simulation accuracy. An extrapolation measure is introduced, which approximates the impact of the synchronization step size on the extrapolation error and thus on the simulation accuracy. Based on this, an optimization approach is presented, which derives the optimal synchronization step size to minimize the extrapolation measure.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Buildings in cities are one of the major contributors of  carbon emissions worldwide. Thus improving building energy efficiency is one of the key strategies towards sustainable urbanization. Urban building energy modeling (UBEM) is a valuable methodology to tackle these challenges, as it provides users with the energy demand of the building stock, scenarios evaluation, peak loads and other useful analyses. This paper presents an open-source tool to automatically convert 3D building models into ready-to-run Modelica models for urban energy simulations. The software enables users to create 3D building geometries, perform data enrichment and execute model generation of ready-to-run reduced order Modelica models. The software is written in Python and it has been developed as an add-on for the 3D creation application Blender. The first part of the paper describes the general approach and the architecture of the tool. In the second part, a demonstration of the tool’s capabilities is illustrated</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Non-residential buildings are accountable for 11% of global energy-related CO2 emissions (United Nations Environment Programme 2018). To increase the performance in this sector, Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS) is one feasible approach. Therefore, there is need for reliable and fast simulation models. One feasible approach are so called Reduced Order Models (ROMs). Thus in this paper, a comparison between the results of the established BEPS tool EnergyPlus and a ROM in Modelica with a reduced number of resistances and capacities is applied at the use case of a non-residential building. A self-developed toolchain was used to create equal models for ROM and EnergyPlus based on the same Building Information Modeling (BIM) model. The comparison shows that the reduced model deviates by 10%in annual heating and cooling. To increase accuracy and decrease computational effort the zoning strategy of non-residential buildings is investigated. The investigation shows that using a suitable zoning approach can reduce the computational effort by up to 97 %.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Increased demand for customized products and reduced manufacturing times are key drivers towards modern, automated manufacturing systems. Manufacturing companies increasingly rely on simulation models of their manufacturing systems, with the goal to optimize critical production parameters and programming of their industrial assets. Simulation driven optimization concepts like digital twin and virtual commissioning are gaining popularity among manufacturing units to drive production rates higher. Manufacturing systems in the aerospace domain are highly complex, due to component size, tight tolerance requirements, and multi-tier manufacturing processes. Accurate simulations of robots and other programmable assets are needed, in order to lower the risk of collisions and manufacturing down times.In practice, this leads to inhomogeneous and even proprietary simulation
environments, with different software interfaces.
In this paper we introduce an accurate robotic arm simulation for industrial manufacturing robots that is based on open standards. This simulation environment is based on two open access standards, namely the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) and the Distributed Co-Simulation Protocol (DCP). In such a virtualized manufacturing process, the number of involved stakeholders is significantly higher. It includes software and simulation tool vendors, as well as robotic system providers. In such an environment, a modular software architecture based on open access standards is considered beneficial. The high number of aircraft customizations leads to continuous reprogramming of the involved systems. The challenge is to keep up with constant-quality manufacturing processes for aircraft components, requiring high levels of accuracy and reliability.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper describes a collaborative digital twin approach
for equipment dimensioning and selection in
industrial process plants. Dynamic process simulator
(Apros) was used to model the process and its automation,
including pumps, while a product specific dynamic
simulator (Virtual Drive) was used to model the
motor and frequency converter. This approach allows
all stakeholders to design and dimension the process
equipment together in a holistic and energy optimal
way. Simulation can be used to reach an optimal equipment
solution that prevents overdimensioning, leading
to up-front and total life-cycle cost savings.
Co-simulation was made possible by implementing
a prototype Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) for
both Apros 6 and Virtual Drive, allowing Apros to
import Virtual Drive as a Functional Mock-up Unit
(FMU). This paper shows how the FMI solution can be
used for finding energy optimal selections for pumps
and related powertrain products.</td></tr>
