<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Providing modelling and simulation capabilities as a service promises to increase their value by improving accessibility for non-expert users and software agents as well as by leveraging cloud-computing technology to scale simulation performance beyond the capabilities of a single computer. In order to reach this potential, implementations must align their design with the architectural styles of cloud computing applications and the web in general. We present an open-source, cloud-native Simulation as a Service (SIMaaS)-implementation that gives access to models and allows simulating them on the web. The implementation uses Functional Mockup Units (FMUs) for co-simulation as an executable form of a model and relies on FMPy for simulation. It is realized as a microservice in the form of a REST-based HTTP-API. Functionality and performance are demonstrated by using the service to create ensemble forecasts for PV systems and to search for an optimal parameter set using a genetic algorithm. Conceptual limitations and the resulting opportunities for further work are summarized.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The development and simulation of engineering systems, especially wind turbines, is becoming increasingly complex and elaborate. At the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy Systems (IWES), the in-house developed tool MoWiT (Modelica library for Wind Turbines) is being developed for load simulation. MoWiT is based on Modelica and is constantly evolving. It is, thus, also becoming more and more enhanced. This results in an increased need for automation for the complex simulation setups and a need for quality assurance of simulation code used. Test automation is used to always ensure the quality of the code. The automation of various simulations and the test automation for the load simulation code are provided by PyWiT (Python Framework for Wind Turbines), which will be presented here in more detail.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>In order to improve the quality of model based development and to reduce testing effort DevOps practices gain more and more importance. However, most system engineers are not DevOps specialists and there are a lot of manual steps involved when writing build pipelines and configurations of simulations. For this purpose an abstract graph-based metadata model is proposed which allows to auto generate scenario descriptions for the DCP standard and code for the build server where the simulation is set up and executed. A simple use case is described as an example of how this could be applied in practice. Furthermore, a Python implementation of a DCP master and a simple FMI to DCP wrapper are presented in this as well.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Co-simulation is a means to combine and leverage the strengths of different modeling tools, environments and formalisms and has been applied successfully in various domains. The Functional Mock-Up Interface (FMI) is the most commonly used standard for co-simulation. In this paper we extend UniFMU, a tool that allows users to build Functional Mock-Up Units (FMUs) in virtually any programming language, to support execution within Docker. As a result the generated FMUs can be distributed in an environment containing all runtime dependencies. To describe the process of creating dockerized FMUs using UniFMU, we show how to model and co-simulate a robotic arm and a controller using two Python-based FMUs.</td></tr>
