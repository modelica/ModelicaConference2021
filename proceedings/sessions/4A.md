<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper presents the simulation of electromagnetic transients (EMTs) with Modelica. The advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Simulation performance and accuracy are analyzed through the IEEE 118-bus benchmark which includes detailed models with nonlinearities. The domain-specific simulator EMTP is used for validations and comparisons.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Hybrid testing is an experimental technique extensively utilized in earthquake engineering to study the seismic response of structures. It requires coupling physical and numerical models in a closed feedback loop. 
Although this methodology is mature, a commonly accepted standard for orchestrating simulations and experiments is still missing. 
As a result, setting up a hybrid testing campaign still requires substantial system integration effort, which is often not affordable. 
In this paper, we propose the Functional Mockup Interface as a possible standard for orchestrating hybrid testing and discuss the limitations in enabling such support.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper covers two major subjects: First, the presentation of a new open-source library called FMI.jl for integrating FMI into the Julia programming environment by providing the possibility to load, parameterize and simulate FMUs. Further, an extension to this library called FMIFlux.jl is introduced, that allows the integration of FMUs into a neural network topology to obtain a NeuralFMU. This structural combination of an industry typical black-box model and a data-driven machine learning model combines the different advantages of both modeling approaches in one single development environment. This allows for the usage of advanced data driven modeling techniques for physical effects that are difficult to model based on first principles.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>In Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE), some functional sub-systems can have a considerable influence on the overall system behaviour, whilst the effect of other ones can be neglected. Of course, the former requires a refined modelling approach, whilst the latter can be suitably represented by means of low-fidelity models (usually 0D models). Being capable of identifying the required precision level of sub-systems can help reducing the system complexity, with a negligible impact on the overall accuracy and help deepen the calculations in the system parts where it is necessary.<br>

To determine which sub-systems models must be refined, suitable indicators must be introduced to assess their influence on the global system behaviour. To this purpose, in this work, a sensitivity analysis based on Sobol&#x27;s indices coupled with a simple mechanical model developed in the Modelica environment is proposed to achieve the aforementioned task.</td></tr>
