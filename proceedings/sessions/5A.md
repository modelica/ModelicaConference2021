<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper introduces ScalableTestGrids, an open-source and flexible benchmark suite for assessing the performance of Modelica tools on large-scale power system test cases. The benchmark suite is built by using components from the PowerGrids library and generic utility scripts creating the final runnable Modelica models. It does not depend on confidential data; its structure makes any future needed modification or evolution easy and straightforward. Results obtained with the OpenModelica tool are also reported. The benchmark suite can be used by tool developers to assess the capability of their tools to handle large-scale power generation and transmission models.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Modeling and simulation is more and more used in the design process in a wide area of applications. Rising demands and the complexity of modern products also increases the need for models and tools capable to cover areas such as virtual testing, design-space exploration or digital twins, and to provide measures of the quality of the
models and the achieved results. In this article, we try to summarize the state-of-the-art and best-practice from the viewpoint of a Modelica language user, based on the experience gained in projects in which Modelica models have been utilized in the design process. Furthermore, missing features and gaps in the used processes are identified.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>In data-driven bearing fault diagnosis, sufficient fault data is fundamental for algorithm training and validation, however, in most industry applications, only very few fault measurements can be provided, which brings bearing dynamics model as an alternative of experimental test bench to produce bearing response under defects. In this paper, a Modelica model for the whole bearing test rig was built, including test bearing, driving motor and hydraulic loading system. For the test bearing, a 5 degree-of-freedom (5-DoF) model was proposed to identify the normal bearing dynamics, and a fault model was employed to characterize defect position, defect size, defect shape and multiple defects. Theory and process to implement the virtual bearing test bench in Modelica were detailed, and 3 cases were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The  design  process  of  buildings  and  energy  supply systems consists of several steps with increasing accuracy and decreasing fault tolerance. Because of a wide range of unknowns and increasing complexity, Modelica models are  often  an  integral  part  of  the  first  design  steps. However, there are only rare updates and reuse of these 
models in later phases and/or during building use. 
This  paper  emphasizes  the  potential  of  a  continuous update and use of available Modelica models during all steps of building design processes. It therefore regards an 
example of a research greenhouse building for which the initially  developed  Modelica models  were  continuously updated  and  reused  during  the  final  phase  of  intensive scientific  monitoring.  Furthermore,  general  insights  in latest  scientific  approaches  indicate  suitable  steps  of partly-automated  continuous  model  updates  during  the whole building life span using BIM (Building Information Modeling).</td></tr>
