<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper presents the modelling of a synchronisation control as used inside a typical hydro power controller for small hydro power plants.
It was built using the open-source modelling language Modelica by use of the Modelica Standard Library, the OpenIPSL and the OpenHPL.<br>

The resulting model allows for both transient and long-term simulations for the complete hydro power system with the main functions available and working.
This includes water-level control, frequency control, voltage control with a power factor control and the synchronisation sequence.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>In recent years the operation of electrical power plants has become more and more challenging due to a more dynamic operation pattern in order to keep the voltage quality within the limits of what the electrical network regulators allow.
This is due to the ever increasing amount of unregulated renewable energy (e.g., wind, solar, tidal power).
There is a need for better tools that allow for a better and more accurate simulation of the operation of a electrical power plant.
This paper presents the development of protective limiters as used in a typical hydro power controller.
The limiters have been implemented using the Modelica language and are  according to the IEEE Std 421.5-201.
The behaviour of the limiters have been tested against a verified generator model of the OpenIPSL comparing the theoretical behaviour.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Offshore oil and gas platforms can accelerate their shift towards lower greenhouse gases emissions by combining wind power generation and energy storage systems. However, the variability of the wind resources and power demand, and the limited storage capacity make the design of the system particularly challenging. We present a modelica library at its early stage of the development and yet with promising results. The model will be used to simulate the dynamic of the whole system for a long period of time using simplified power components and balanced micro grid. This paper shares some preliminary results by applying the model on a data set of wind resources and power demand from the North Sea. The results are the power system dynamics and an approximation of the mass of greenhouse gas emissions. On the long term the model will be applied to determine the right control and optimization strategy to control the energy system towards lower greenhouse gas emissions without compromising the balance between the power supply and demand.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper presents the open-source implementation in Modelica of the generic photovoltaics and wind turbine generator models introduced by the Western Electricity Coordinating Counsil (WECC) Renewable Energy Modeling Task Force. These dynamic models have been designed to be easily understandable and reusable by adopting the same decomposition as in the original WECC reports, using as much as possible existing Modelica Standard Library blocks and extending common parts whenever possible. The results obtained with OpenModelica and Dynaωo simulations have been successfully validated against different reference simulation tools.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>As world is moving towards renewable energy sources for sustainable energy, Concentrated solar power systems with thermal energy storage present significant opportunities for generating electricity.  This paper describes an effort to develop an analytic platform for Brayton cycle and connect it to Central receiver CSP system to form a complete system. Already analytical model for Central receiver CSP system with Rankine cycle was developed and available with us (Edman, 2015; Windahl, 2015). This paper describes the development of a Supercritical CO2 recompression Brayton cycle based on the information available in literature [Dennis, 2017]. Effect of change in turbine inlet temperature on the performance and efficiency of Brayton cycle are shown.  Integration of Brayton cycle with CSP system is done and the solar power requirement based on turbine inlet temperatures is studied.</td></tr>
