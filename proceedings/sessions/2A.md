<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper investigates steady-state initialization both 
symbolically and numerically, and in particular 
demonstrates new ways of adapting the symbolic methods 
for finding steady-state solutions for Modelica models 
extending ideas that were previously manually 
implemented in libraries. The methods are compared on 
realistic Modelica models in Dymola.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>To get reliable simulation results from a Modelica model it is important to parametrize and initialize the model using the best estimate of the state of the system. Commonly, this state estimation is done by inverse calculation on a square system of equations requiring as many known values as states to be computed. In practice this constraint is an important limitation and, in addition, this method does not provide any information on the uncertainties or confidence level associated to the estimated state.
Taking advantage of the mathematical formulation of Modelica equations, this paper presents a new method to cope with the difficulties associated to the inverse calculation method. This approach adapts and extends the framework of data assimilation to provide a fully-integrated Modelica tool, which efficiently can handle every type of state estimation problem for static models. This method has been successfully tested with simple and complex Modelica models. Finally, the Modelica implementation of this technique allows to easily extend it to further applications.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This article presents the different approaches and use cases for efficient parameterization of Modelica models by means of external data resources. The main motivation is to improve the overall quality, testability and reusability of Modelica application models (both on component and system level) by a separation of the behavioral implementation from its actual design parameters. The Modelica libraries ExternData and ModelicaTableAdditions are freely available to support library developers and vendors in their ambitions to offer clean and dedicated interfaces for the parameterization of the application models and to benefit from a large variability of commonly used file types, such as CSV, Excel, HDF, JSON, MATLAB MAT, XML or even domain-specific file types such as for tire properties or weather data.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper presents a tool to populate power flow results for phasor time-domain simulations with the Open Instance Power System Library (OpenIPSL). Our proposal takes advantage of the object-oriented philosophy of Modelica and introduces a data structure based on records to handle power flow data for a given network model. Such records constitute a user-friendly interface to change the guess values used to solve the initial condition of a dynamical simulation straightforwardly. Power flow calculations are carried out by the open-source Python library GridCal. We demonstrate the tool capabilities by generating power flow results for several grid models and comparing them with those obtained via proprietary tools such as PSS/E. Moreover, we provide tutorial materials to ease integrating the tool for a new/experienced OpenIPSL user.</td></tr>
