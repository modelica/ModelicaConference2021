<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The open-source Modelica library TransiEnt Library was developed within the research project TransiEnt.EE. This paper presents two major extensions to this library which were developed in the follow-up research project ResiliEntEE. The modeling of the power sector on transmission grid level is possible due to the implementation of the complex bus voltage. In the gas sector, the efficiency of the computation of mass and energy balances was improved. Furthermore, an efficient physical pressure loss model was added that leads to more realistic results and faster simulations. The possible application of the library are presented in an exemplary simulation of an integrated energy system. It is shown that the dynamic simulation allows the depiction of disturbances and their possible consequences in coupled sectors. Thus, next to cost and CO2 emission, an integrated energy system can be assessed in terms of its resilience as well.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>In this paper, the next generation of model-based visu-
alization is introduced, the DLR Visualization 2 Library.
This new real-time graphics environment for Modelica is
equipped with a state of the art engine for physics based
lighting calculation and high-definition render quality, si-
multaneous visualization of parallel running simulation
models, new features like a modern streaming interface
and a new, cleaner library structure. It enables the user to
create graphical real-time environments for virtual com-
missioning of complex systems of systems and imaging
based sensors. Some applications, as for example depth-
camera data generation or rendering of point clouds or
vectorized flow visualization are demonstrated in the use
cases section of this paper</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is often named as a prospective enabler for future automation systems integrations, as for example envisioned in the German Initiative Industrie 4.0. The DLR OPC UA Modelica library connects OPC UA with the Modelica world. There are two main goals: First, OPC UA server capabilities for emulating the communication interface of (physical) hardware components in order to create component simulations, e.g., for virtual commissioning. Second, OPC UA client capabilities for interacting with real-world hardware components, e.g., for process visualization and monitoring or interactive simulation and control purposes. The library works on Windows and Linux platforms. It is tested using the Modelica environments Dymola and OpenModelica.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Based  on  the  Thermal  Runaway  (TR)  experiments  con-ducted  in  our  laboratory  a  simple  method  of  describ-ing  a  battery’s  thermal  behaviour  was  developed.Inthe  approach  -  which  we  callsimple tracing method-the temperature rate measurement from Accelerating RateCalorimetry  (ARC)  during  a  TR  experiment  is  approxi-mated to determine the thermal behaviour of the model.This method was implemented in Modelica using Dymola.Alongside  the  implementation  of  the  TR  model  a  com-plete Modelica package with useful models for TR prop-agation  simulation  was  developed.   The  package  called“BatterySafety”serves as a foundation for further modeldevelopment to investigate TR propagation and physicalcounter measures in greater detail.   The focus of all themodels in the package was efficiency,  intelligibility anduser-friendliness. With this approach we are able to simu-late TR propagation of a complete battery pack.</td></tr>
