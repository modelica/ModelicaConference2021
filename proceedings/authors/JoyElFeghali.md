<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Energy production and consumption systems increasingly require more flexibility. The design of new control solutions can be a step, among others, towards flexibility. However, these control solutions often rely on the use of complex models, which are difficult to both manipulate and simulate. This paper presents a solution to reduce the complexity of multi-energy models modeled with Modelica language. This complexity-reducing solution is based on simplifying the model&#x27;s components that contribute less to the total energy using an energy-based ranking technique. The solution is successfully applied to a complex city district model. A property of the Modelica language further allows replacing low-ranked components without being compelled to fully redesign the model. Criteria verifying the multi-energy reduced model&#x27;s precision, while respecting physical constraints, are also introduced.</td></tr>
