<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) (Modelica Association 2021[b]) is a tool independent standard for the exchange of dynamic models and for co-simulation.  FMI2.0, released in 2014, is recognized as the de-facto standard in industry for exchanging models and tool coupling,and is currently supported by more than 160 simulation tools. Version 3.0 of the standard brings many new features that allow  for  advanced co-simulation  algorithms and new use cases such as packaging and simulation of highly accurate virtual Electronic Control Units (vECUs). Besides Model-Exchange and Co-Simulation, a third interface type, Scheduled Execution, is defined for purely discrete, RTOS-like, simulation and supports preemption.Clocks allow the synchronization of events between Functional  Mock-up Units (FMUs)  and  the  importer. There is better support for data types including binary data and arrays.   Advanced co-simulation approaches are enabled by intermediate variable access between communication points and allowing event handling. The composition of systems from  FMUs is simplified by terminals that can bundle multiple signals. The concept of layered standards allows the extension of the FMI standard.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper gives an overview of the FMI 3.0 support for two kinds of clock-based simulations: Synchronous Clocked Simulation, and Scheduled Execution.
The former is used when the information about multiple simultaneous events (cause and exact time of occurrence) can be unambiguously conveyed.
The later facilitates real-time simulations comprising multiple black-box models, by allowing fine grained control over the computation time of sub-models.
A formalization is presented along with example application scenarios, meant as an introduction to the conceptualization of clocks in the FMI Standard.</td></tr>
