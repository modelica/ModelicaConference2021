<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Since its version 3.3, the Modelica language offers the possibility to model multimode systems having different DAE-based dynamics in each mode, thanks to the introduction of state machines. When the differentiation index and structure varies with mode changes, compilers generate erroneous simulation code, often resulting in runtime exceptions.<br>

We propose in this paper amultimode structural analysis for both multiple modes and mode change events and we show how correct code for restarts can be generated. Our approach is illustrated on two simple but representative mechanical systems.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Since its 3.3 release, Modelica offers the possibility to specify models of dynamical systems with multiple modes having different DAE-based dynamics. However, the handling of such models by the current Modelica tools is not satisfactory, with mathematically sound models yielding exceptions at runtime. In this article, we propose a systematic way of rewriting a multimode Modelica model, based on the results of an already implemented multimode structural analysis. The rewritten Modelica model is guaranteed to be correctly compiled by state-of-the-art Modelica tools. Simulation results are presented on a simple, yet meaningful, physical system whose original Modelica model is not correctly handled by state-of-the-art Modelica tools.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Since its 3.3 release, Modelica offers the possibility to specify models of dynamical systems with multiple modes having different DAE-based dynamics. However, the handling of mode changes by the current Modelica tools is not satisfactory. <br>

An important difficulty is the occurrence of impulsive behavior at some mode changes, for some variables. In this paper, we propose a compile-time algorithm for identifying such impulsive behaviors and quantifying them in terms of their magnitude orders. Such algorithm can be used as an additional step of the structural analysis of Modelica models.</td></tr>
