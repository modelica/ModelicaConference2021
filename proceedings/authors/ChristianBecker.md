<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The open-source Modelica library TransiEnt Library was developed within the research project TransiEnt.EE. This paper presents two major extensions to this library which were developed in the follow-up research project ResiliEntEE. The modeling of the power sector on transmission grid level is possible due to the implementation of the complex bus voltage. In the gas sector, the efficiency of the computation of mass and energy balances was improved. Furthermore, an efficient physical pressure loss model was added that leads to more realistic results and faster simulations. The possible application of the library are presented in an exemplary simulation of an integrated energy system. It is shown that the dynamic simulation allows the depiction of disturbances and their possible consequences in coupled sectors. Thus, next to cost and CO2 emission, an integrated energy system can be assessed in terms of its resilience as well.</td></tr>
