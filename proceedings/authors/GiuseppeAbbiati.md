<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Hybrid testing is an experimental technique extensively utilized in earthquake engineering to study the seismic response of structures. It requires coupling physical and numerical models in a closed feedback loop. 
Although this methodology is mature, a commonly accepted standard for orchestrating simulations and experiments is still missing. 
As a result, setting up a hybrid testing campaign still requires substantial system integration effort, which is often not affordable. 
In this paper, we propose the Functional Mockup Interface as a possible standard for orchestrating hybrid testing and discuss the limitations in enabling such support.</td></tr>
