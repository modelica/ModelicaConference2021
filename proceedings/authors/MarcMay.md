<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>In this paper, aircraft mission simulation in Modelica with multidisciplinary models is described. This includes for example a Flight Control System (FCS) accompanied by a Flight Management System (FMS), a detailed aircraft implementation including several subsystems (for example landing gears, actuation and sensor systems), and the application of the integrated setup to realistic mission scenarios.</td></tr>
