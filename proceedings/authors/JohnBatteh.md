<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper describes the modeling and simulation of the RespiraWorks ventilator in Modelica with Modelon Impact and the Pneumatics Library.  Following a brief overview of the RespiraWorks open-source effort in response to COVID-19, details of the pneumatic modeling effort, including the implementation of new components,  are provided in support of the model-based development process.  The pneumatics models of several different iterations of the ventilator design are shown.  Lastly an overview of the model calibration process is provided, and the model results are compared with experimental data collected from the ventilator prototype.</td></tr>
