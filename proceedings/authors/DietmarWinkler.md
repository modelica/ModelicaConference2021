<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This article presents the different approaches and use cases for efficient parameterization of Modelica models by means of external data resources. The main motivation is to improve the overall quality, testability and reusability of Modelica application models (both on component and system level) by a separation of the behavioral implementation from its actual design parameters. The Modelica libraries ExternData and ModelicaTableAdditions are freely available to support library developers and vendors in their ambitions to offer clean and dedicated interfaces for the parameterization of the application models and to benefit from a large variability of commonly used file types, such as CSV, Excel, HDF, JSON, MATLAB MAT, XML or even domain-specific file types such as for tire properties or weather data.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper presents the modelling of a synchronisation control as used inside a typical hydro power controller for small hydro power plants.
It was built using the open-source modelling language Modelica by use of the Modelica Standard Library, the OpenIPSL and the OpenHPL.<br>

The resulting model allows for both transient and long-term simulations for the complete hydro power system with the main functions available and working.
This includes water-level control, frequency control, voltage control with a power factor control and the synchronisation sequence.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>In recent years the operation of electrical power plants has become more and more challenging due to a more dynamic operation pattern in order to keep the voltage quality within the limits of what the electrical network regulators allow.
This is due to the ever increasing amount of unregulated renewable energy (e.g., wind, solar, tidal power).
There is a need for better tools that allow for a better and more accurate simulation of the operation of a electrical power plant.
This paper presents the development of protective limiters as used in a typical hydro power controller.
The limiters have been implemented using the Modelica language and are  according to the IEEE Std 421.5-201.
The behaviour of the limiters have been tested against a verified generator model of the OpenIPSL comparing the theoretical behaviour.</td></tr>
