<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper introduces ScalableTestGrids, an open-source and flexible benchmark suite for assessing the performance of Modelica tools on large-scale power system test cases. The benchmark suite is built by using components from the PowerGrids library and generic utility scripts creating the final runnable Modelica models. It does not depend on confidential data; its structure makes any future needed modification or evolution easy and straightforward. Results obtained with the OpenModelica tool are also reported. The benchmark suite can be used by tool developers to assess the capability of their tools to handle large-scale power generation and transmission models.</td></tr>
