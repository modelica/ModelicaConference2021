<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Based  on  the  Thermal  Runaway  (TR)  experiments  con-ducted  in  our  laboratory  a  simple  method  of  describ-ing  a  battery’s  thermal  behaviour  was  developed.Inthe  approach  -  which  we  callsimple tracing method-the temperature rate measurement from Accelerating RateCalorimetry  (ARC)  during  a  TR  experiment  is  approxi-mated to determine the thermal behaviour of the model.This method was implemented in Modelica using Dymola.Alongside  the  implementation  of  the  TR  model  a  com-plete Modelica package with useful models for TR prop-agation  simulation  was  developed.   The  package  called“BatterySafety”serves as a foundation for further modeldevelopment to investigate TR propagation and physicalcounter measures in greater detail.   The focus of all themodels in the package was efficiency,  intelligibility anduser-friendliness. With this approach we are able to simu-late TR propagation of a complete battery pack.</td></tr>
