<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>In this paper, the next generation of model-based visu-
alization is introduced, the DLR Visualization 2 Library.
This new real-time graphics environment for Modelica is
equipped with a state of the art engine for physics based
lighting calculation and high-definition render quality, si-
multaneous visualization of parallel running simulation
models, new features like a modern streaming interface
and a new, cleaner library structure. It enables the user to
create graphical real-time environments for virtual com-
missioning of complex systems of systems and imaging
based sensors. Some applications, as for example depth-
camera data generation or rendering of point clouds or
vectorized flow visualization are demonstrated in the use
cases section of this paper</td></tr>
