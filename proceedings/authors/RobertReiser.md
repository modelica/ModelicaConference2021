<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper introduces a new library for the manipulation and assembly of 3D objects using Modelica. The method is based on collision detection, contact dynamics, position and orientation control as well as states for object manipulation. The aim is a stable and efficient simulation of these processes close to real physics. 3D objects (both elementary shapes and CAD objects) can be added from the library browser to a model by drag-and-drop and are directly capable of being manipulated by multiple grippers and conveyors or being assembled to an assembly. This allows a high degree of flexibility and the modeling effort can be decreased significantly.</td></tr>
