<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper presents a tool to populate power flow results for phasor time-domain simulations with the Open Instance Power System Library (OpenIPSL). Our proposal takes advantage of the object-oriented philosophy of Modelica and introduces a data structure based on records to handle power flow data for a given network model. Such records constitute a user-friendly interface to change the guess values used to solve the initial condition of a dynamical simulation straightforwardly. Power flow calculations are carried out by the open-source Python library GridCal. We demonstrate the tool capabilities by generating power flow results for several grid models and comparing them with those obtained via proprietary tools such as PSS/E. Moreover, we provide tutorial materials to ease integrating the tool for a new/experienced OpenIPSL user.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>A Modelica model of a of a rocket&#x27;s first stage is developed, designed to be representative of the launch vehicles in use in the United States in the late 2010s. The model uses initial conditions similar to those observed immediately after a second stage separation at 166km altitude. A control system is developed enabling the rocket first stage to land back on Earth&#x27;s surface at a predetermined landing pad in a controlled manner. The control system is evaluated based on its ability to compensate for altered initial conditions, as well as its ability to minimize acceleration forces and fuel consumption. The flight path of the simulated first stage rocket is compared to real-life telemetry data from a first stage rocket landing showing a similar trajectory.</td></tr>
