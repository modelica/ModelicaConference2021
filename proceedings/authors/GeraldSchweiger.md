<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Future intelligent and integrated energy systems must have a high degree of flexibility and efficiency to ensure reliable and sustainable operation. 
Along with the rapid expansion of renewable energy, this degree of flexibility and efficiency can be achieved by overcoming the clear separation between different sectors and by increasing connectivity and the associated data availability through the integration of sensors and edge/fog computing \cite{vatanparvar2018}. 
All of these developments drive the transition from towards so-called Cyber-Physical Energy Systems . 
The Cyber technologies (sensors, edge/fog computing, IoT networks, etc.) are able to monitor the physical systems, to enable communication between different subsystems and to control them.
The emergence of Cyber-Physical Systems poses new challenges for traditional modelling and simulation approaches.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Co-simulation is a means to combine and leverage the strengths of different modeling tools, environments and formalisms and has been applied successfully in various domains. The Functional Mock-Up Interface (FMI) is the most commonly used standard for co-simulation. In this paper we extend UniFMU, a tool that allows users to build Functional Mock-Up Units (FMUs) in virtually any programming language, to support execution within Docker. As a result the generated FMUs can be distributed in an environment containing all runtime dependencies. To describe the process of creating dockerized FMUs using UniFMU, we show how to model and co-simulate a robotic arm and a controller using two Python-based FMUs.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Decarbonization of industry is a key challenge to achieve the Paris climate goals. Digitalization of the industry is a cornerstone of this journey. In this paper we present our modelling work towards the creation of a Digital Energy Twin of the energy supply system of a printed boarding circuit manufacturing by means of a classical use case, system design optimization. The simulation approach allowed us to fairly compare the improvements done in the energy supply system by evaluating those under the same operating conditions. Integration of waste chiller’s waste heat can cover most of the low temperature grid heat demand while the additional generation of chilled water reduces the amount of water pump from and back to the river.</td></tr>
