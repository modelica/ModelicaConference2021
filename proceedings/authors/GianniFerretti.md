<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>In this paper, the development of Digital Twins of parallel manipulator is described, based on components of the Modelica standard library only. At first, the dynamic model of a Delta robot is illustrated and validated with respect to experimental data. Then, the model of a Stewart platform is discussed. Thanks to the symbolic manipulation capabilities of the OpenModelica compiler, the model is then used to automatically generate the inverse dynamics, which is in general is a quite difficult task to be performed manually.</td></tr>
