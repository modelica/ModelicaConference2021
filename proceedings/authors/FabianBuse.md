<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The application of simulation in the development of complex systems becomes more and more important. Modeled systems often are comprised of mechanical, electrical as well as software systems. It is usually not possible anymore to evaluate a systems performance without considering some higher level logic. Scripting languages such as Lua, are often well suited to implement these logic elements. This paper shows the integration of the Lua interpreter into Modelica, and gives examples how the library can be used to help with the simulation industrial robots or in the development of a planetary exploration rover in the MMX Mission.</td></tr>
