<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper describes a collaborative digital twin approach
for equipment dimensioning and selection in
industrial process plants. Dynamic process simulator
(Apros) was used to model the process and its automation,
including pumps, while a product specific dynamic
simulator (Virtual Drive) was used to model the
motor and frequency converter. This approach allows
all stakeholders to design and dimension the process
equipment together in a holistic and energy optimal
way. Simulation can be used to reach an optimal equipment
solution that prevents overdimensioning, leading
to up-front and total life-cycle cost savings.
Co-simulation was made possible by implementing
a prototype Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) for
both Apros 6 and Virtual Drive, allowing Apros to
import Virtual Drive as a Functional Mock-up Unit
(FMU). This paper shows how the FMI solution can be
used for finding energy optimal selections for pumps
and related powertrain products.</td></tr>
