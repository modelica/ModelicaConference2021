<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper presents the simulation of electromagnetic transients (EMTs) with Modelica. The advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Simulation performance and accuracy are analyzed through the IEEE 118-bus benchmark which includes detailed models with nonlinearities. The domain-specific simulator EMTP is used for validations and comparisons.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper introduces ScalableTestGrids, an open-source and flexible benchmark suite for assessing the performance of Modelica tools on large-scale power system test cases. The benchmark suite is built by using components from the PowerGrids library and generic utility scripts creating the final runnable Modelica models. It does not depend on confidential data; its structure makes any future needed modification or evolution easy and straightforward. Results obtained with the OpenModelica tool are also reported. The benchmark suite can be used by tool developers to assess the capability of their tools to handle large-scale power generation and transmission models.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper presents the open-source implementation in Modelica of the generic photovoltaics and wind turbine generator models introduced by the Western Electricity Coordinating Counsil (WECC) Renewable Energy Modeling Task Force. These dynamic models have been designed to be easily understandable and reusable by adopting the same decomposition as in the original WECC reports, using as much as possible existing Modelica Standard Library blocks and extending common parts whenever possible. The results obtained with OpenModelica and Dynaωo simulations have been successfully validated against different reference simulation tools.</td></tr>
