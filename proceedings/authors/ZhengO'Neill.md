<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Energy storage systems have been gaining attention as a means of load management in grid-interactive efficient buildings. This study investigated the physics of the ice storage tank (IST) and implemented an IST model in Modelica. The developed IST Modelica model was compared with a similar model in EnergyPlus and was validated against experimental data from a testbed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Three statistical performance metrics were used to quantify the accuracy of the IST model. Validation results (CV(RMSE) ≤ 10.20 %, NMBE ≤ 0.44 %) show that the proposed model has a good prediction accuracy according to ASHRAE Guideline 14.</td></tr>
