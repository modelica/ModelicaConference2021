<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>We present a physics based Modelica ﬁnite volume ﬂow model that separately balances vapour and liquid phase. By using extensive state variables and a special mass ﬂow regularisation, the model can cope with the possible vanishing or emerging of a phase in a numerically robust way. Although at prototype stage, the model already exhibits all required capabilities. These are demonstrated in feature testers and in a model of a natural convection driven cooling cycle operating under external acceleration forces.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>We present an assessment of different types of hydrogen storages used as long term energy buffers for a local community complex of households in terms of economics and energy autarky. The models used in this study are partly based on the TransiEnt Modelica Library, which is being developed for the dynamic simulation of coupled energy supply systems with high shares of renewable energies. It turns out that dynamic simulations are mandatory in order to optimise the system parameters. Starting from a best case evaluation of a one year linear optimisation we develop a forecast based control logic of the whole energy system, including its physicalities. Based on our results, a storage consisting of pressurized gas bottles has proven to be the most favourite solution in terms of price and level of autarky. A liquid organic hydrogen carrier might be a competitive alternative for larger urban districts.</td></tr>
