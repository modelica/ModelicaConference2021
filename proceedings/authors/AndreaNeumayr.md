<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>A new design of the Modia experimental modeling language based on Julia is presented. It has simple yet powerful syntax and semantics. A unified means of describing the fundamental semantics, which is similar to Modelica, is outlined. Furthermore, it is shown how domain specific algorithms can be combined with equation based modeling. It is demonstrated for multibody systems and will enable more efficient translation and simulation since much repetitive analysis and transformations are avoided. The drive train of a robot model was automatically translated from Modelica to Modia. Modern simulation algorithms from the Julia community allow working with automatic differentiation and uncertainties.</td></tr>
