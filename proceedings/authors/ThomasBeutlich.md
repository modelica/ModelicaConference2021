<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This article presents the different approaches and use cases for efficient parameterization of Modelica models by means of external data resources. The main motivation is to improve the overall quality, testability and reusability of Modelica application models (both on component and system level) by a separation of the behavioral implementation from its actual design parameters. The Modelica libraries ExternData and ModelicaTableAdditions are freely available to support library developers and vendors in their ambitions to offer clean and dedicated interfaces for the parameterization of the application models and to benefit from a large variability of commonly used file types, such as CSV, Excel, HDF, JSON, MATLAB MAT, XML or even domain-specific file types such as for tire properties or weather data.</td></tr>
