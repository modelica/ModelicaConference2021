<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The  design  process  of  buildings  and  energy  supply systems consists of several steps with increasing accuracy and decreasing fault tolerance. Because of a wide range of unknowns and increasing complexity, Modelica models are  often  an  integral  part  of  the  first  design  steps. However, there are only rare updates and reuse of these 
models in later phases and/or during building use. 
This  paper  emphasizes  the  potential  of  a  continuous update and use of available Modelica models during all steps of building design processes. It therefore regards an 
example of a research greenhouse building for which the initially  developed  Modelica models  were  continuously updated  and  reused  during  the  final  phase  of  intensive scientific  monitoring.  Furthermore,  general  insights  in latest  scientific  approaches  indicate  suitable  steps  of partly-automated  continuous  model  updates  during  the whole building life span using BIM (Building Information Modeling).</td></tr>
