<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper summarizes the final research results of the ITEA3 project EMPHYSIS (embedded systems with physical models in the production code software). Its core achievement is the new open eFMI Standard enabling new automated workflows from high level physical models to automotive compliant embedded software. eFMI (FMI for embedded systems) defines a container architecture for model exchange, testing and automatic model transformations. Multiple representations from a high-level intermediate representation of sampled algorithms (GALEC) to production and binary code for specific embedded targets are maintained in a traceable workspace. The successful integration of the developed eFMI tooling is demonstrated by a comprehensive open source Modelica test cases library and industrial demonstrators. The readiness of the proposed approach is proven by compliance checks according to common automotive code quality standards (MISRA) and a performance benchmark in terms of runtime and resource demand in comparison with state of the art hand coded solutions.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>A new design of the Modia experimental modeling language based on Julia is presented. It has simple yet powerful syntax and semantics. A unified means of describing the fundamental semantics, which is similar to Modelica, is outlined. Furthermore, it is shown how domain specific algorithms can be combined with equation based modeling. It is demonstrated for multibody systems and will enable more efficient translation and simulation since much repetitive analysis and transformations are avoided. The drive train of a robot model was automatically translated from Modelica to Modia. Modern simulation algorithms from the Julia community allow working with automatic differentiation and uncertainties.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Modeling and simulation is more and more used in the design process in a wide area of applications. Rising demands and the complexity of modern products also increases the need for models and tools capable to cover areas such as virtual testing, design-space exploration or digital twins, and to provide measures of the quality of the
models and the achieved results. In this article, we try to summarize the state-of-the-art and best-practice from the viewpoint of a Modelica language user, based on the experience gained in projects in which Modelica models have been utilized in the design process. Furthermore, missing features and gaps in the used processes are identified.</td></tr>
