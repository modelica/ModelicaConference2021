<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>We present a physics based Modelica ﬁnite volume ﬂow model that separately balances vapour and liquid phase. By using extensive state variables and a special mass ﬂow regularisation, the model can cope with the possible vanishing or emerging of a phase in a numerically robust way. Although at prototype stage, the model already exhibits all required capabilities. These are demonstrated in feature testers and in a model of a natural convection driven cooling cycle operating under external acceleration forces.</td></tr>
