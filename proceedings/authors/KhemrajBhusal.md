<tr><th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper presents the modelling of a synchronisation control as used inside a typical hydro power controller for small hydro power plants.
It was built using the open-source modelling language Modelica by use of the Modelica Standard Library, the OpenIPSL and the OpenHPL.<br>

The resulting model allows for both transient and long-term simulations for the complete hydro power system with the main functions available and working.
This includes water-level control, frequency control, voltage control with a power factor control and the synchronisation sequence.</td></tr>
